<h1>Meta-analysis of open data</h1>
<p>
  Metadataset is a set of open data about how to manage agricultural and natural resources. The data come from scientific studies of management practices (e.g., farming practices) that have effects on agriculture (e.g., crops, soil, or water) or nature (e.g., endangered or invasive species). The data get extracted from scientific publications, transformed into standardized effect sizes, tagged with standardized metadata, and synthesized using meta-analysis.

<h1>Living reviews</h1>
<p>
  Our mission is to create a standardized set of living reviews that get updated almost as soon as new studies get published. Thanks to funding from the <a href="http://www.leventisfoundation.org">Leventis Foundation</a>, we are starting by systematically mapping the evidence for cassava farming practices.
