<h1>Meta-analysis of open data</h1>
<p>
  Metadataset is a collection of open data from scientific publications. These publications are about the management of agricultural and natural resources (e.g., crops, soil, water, and wildlife).
</p>
<p>
  The data are extracted from scientific publications, transformed into standardized effect sizes, tagged with standardized metadata, and synthesized using meta-analysis. This is <span class="red">work in progress</span>. Please <a href="{% url 'signup' %}">sign up</a> if you would like to get updates.
