<h1>Meta-analysis of open data</h1>
<p>Metadataset is a collection of open data from scientific experiments. The data are extracted from scientific publications, transformed into standardized effect sizes, tagged with standardized metadata, and synthesized using meta-analysis.</p>

<h1>Systematic reviews of agricultural practices</h1>
<p>Our mission is to create a standardized collection of systematic reviews of agricultural practices. Thanks to funding from the <a href="http://www.leventisfoundation.org">Leventis Foundation</a>, we are starting by systematically mapping scientific publications about cassava.</p>
