<h1>Meta-analysis of open data</h1>
<p>Metadataset is a collection of open data that are used for meta-analysis. The data are extracted from scientific publications, transformed into standardized effect sizes, and tagged with standardized metadata. Subsets of the data are aggregated into open-source meta-analyses that are moderated by our community of Data Wranglers.</p>

<h1>Systematic reviews of agricultural practices</h1>
<p>Our mission is to create a comprehensive collection of standardized data about sustainable agricultural practices. Thanks to funding from the <a href="http://www.leventisfoundation.org">Leventis Foundation</a>, we are starting this mission by systematically reviewing scientific publications about <a href="#">cassava</a>.</p>
