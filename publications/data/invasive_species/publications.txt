AB  - Plant invasions can considerably modify soil microbial communities and processes. The direction and magnitude of these changes depend on invasive plant species. This problem has been studied in the field using a space-fortime substitution approach, but rarely in experimental conditions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effects on soil microbial properties in a mesocosm experiment of four invasive plant species in Europe, namely, Impatiens glandulifera, Reynoutria japonica, Rudbeckia laciniata and Solidago gigantea, and two expansive species native to Europe but invasive in North America, namely Artemisia vulgaris, Phalaris arundinacea, as well as a mixture of these two species grown in pots in two loamy sand soils differing in elemental concentrations and pH. After two years, microbial activity was measured using soil respiration, urease and arylsulfatase activity; total, bacterial and fungal biomass was measured using substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and/or phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA); and community structure was measured using PLFA. Soil microbial parameters were significantly affected by plant species, soil type and their interaction. Contrary to expectations, R. japonica did not exhibit a strong negative effect on soil microorganisms. Microbial activity and/or biomass in soils under R. japonica, A. vulgaris, R. laciniata and/or species mixture were relatively high, though it depended to some extent on microbial parameters and soil type. In contrast, most microbial parameters had rather low values in bare (unplanted) soil and soils under P. arundinacea and S. gigantea. The largest differences between species were observed in the case of fungal biomass and fungi:bacteria ratio in both soils. Fungal biomass under A. vulgaris and R. japonica was a few times higher than in soils under S. gigantea, P. arundinacea and/or I. glandulifera. Our experiment proved that invasive plant species can modify soil microbial properties considerably during a period as short as two growing seasons. Alterations in the soil environment can potentially be considered as niche construction and support the growth and spread of invaders.

AB  - Invasion of riparian zones by non-native plants is a global issue and commonly perceived as a challenge for river and fishery managers, but the type and extent of ecological changes induced by such invasions remain poorly understood. Established effects on sediment delivery, allochthonous inputs, and channel shading could potentially alter aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages, with implications for in-stream ecological quality. We assessed responses in the diversity, quality, and heterogeneity of stream macroinvertebrate communities to riparian invasion by non-native plants. Macroinvertebrates were collected from 24 sites on low order streams in central and southern Scotland during spring and autumn. The effect of invasive non-native plants (INNP) on macroinvertebrates was assessed relative to that of local physical and chemical factors. Invasive non-native plants cover was associated with stronger effects than other factors on local diversity of macroinvertebrates (33% reduction at the highest INNP cover) but also increased macroinvertebrate abundance across sites. Invaded sites were also associated with lower macroinvertebrate biomonitoring scores. Community composition differed between invaded and uninvaded sites in autumn, but not in spring. However, INNP influence on macroinvertebrate composition was generally secondary to that of physicochemical variables (e.g. channel shade, substrate diversity). We demonstrate that the influence of INNP extends beyond well-known impacts on plant communities to reductions mainly in stream macroinvertebrate diversity. Combined with the negative impact on pollution-sensitive macroinvertebrate taxa this raises concerns over the ecological health of streams with heavily invaded riparian zones. Our findings suggest that efforts to improve low order streams by actively managing severe riparian invasions are merited, but the size and uncertainty of the likely ecological gains must also be evaluated against the effort involved.

AB  - BackgroundThe observation that many alien species become invasive despite low genetic diversity has long been considered the genetic paradox' in invasion biology. This paradox is often resolved through the temporal buildup genetic diversity through multiple introduction events. These temporal dynamics in genetic diversity are especially important for annual invasive plants that lack a persistent seed bank, for which population persistence is strongly dependent on consecutive seed re-establishment' in each growing season. Theory predicts that the number of seeds during re-establishment, and the levels of among-population gene flow can strongly affect recolonization dynamics, resulting in either an erosion or build-up of population genetic diversity through time. This study focuses on temporal changes in the population genetic structure of the annual invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera across Europe. We resampled 13 populations in 6 regions along a 1600km long latitudinal gradient from northern France to central Norway after 5 years, and assessed population genetic diversity with 9 microsatellite markers.ResultsOur study suggests sufficiently high numbers of genetically diverse founders during population re-establishment, which prevent the erosion of local genetic diversity. We furthermore observe that I. glandulifera experiences significant among-population gene flow, gradually resulting in higher genetic diversity and lower overall genetic differentiation through time. Nonetheless, moderate founder effects concerning population genetic composition (allele frequencies) were evident, especially for smaller populations.Despite the initially low genetic diversity, this species seems to be successful at persisting across its invaded range, and will likely continue to build up higher genetic diversity at the local scale.

T2  - Plant Ecology
AB  - The impact of exotic annual Impatiens glandulifera on invaded European vegetation is ambiguous; there are studies reporting considerable negative as well as weak or even no impact of this invader on species richness and diversity of the invaded communities. The effect of invasion by I. glandulifera on species richness, diversity and the composition of resident vegetation was studied in the northern foothills of the Tatra Mountains in southern Poland. Two approaches were used: comparing diversity measures of the invaded and uninvaded plots and analysing changes in species richness and diversity in plots grouped according to increasing cover percentage of I. glandulifera. Invaded plots harboured 0.27 fewer species per 4m(2) and had significantly reduced values of the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices and Pielou's measure of evenness. Analysis of changes in diversity measures with the increase in I. glandulifera cover revealed that an increase in I. glandulifera cover was from the onset related to a decrease in the diversity of the invaded plant communities, but after exceeding a 80% cover, this species dramatically reduced the diversity of the invaded vegetation. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis indicated a significant shift in the composition of invaded plots in relation to uninvaded plots, which resulted from the proportional increase in the more shade tolerant and nutrients demanding species. Our results suggest that in species-rich vegetation, such as fresh meadows and related communities, I. glandulifera may suppress weak competitors and, thus, negatively impact plant diversity.

T2  - Biologia
AB  - Alpine dock (Rumex alpinus) is a native plant species in many European mountain ranges. It comes from moist brushwood and open tall herb communities, though it has invaded mountain pastures. This troublesome weed forms permanent monodominant stands characterised by low nature conservation and agricultural values. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies assessing the impact of R. alpinus on invaded communities. Therefore, in this study we examined the potential effect of an R. alpinus on species richness, diversity and the composition of invaded vegetation in Tatra National Park, Poland. Invaded plots dominated by R. alpinus had, compared to uninvaded control plots, significantly reduced species richness, as well as low Shannon and Simpson diversity and Pielou evenness indices' values; the species richness decline in the pairs of invaded-uninvaded plots was as much as 37.7%. Analysing changes in diversity from an increase in R. alpinus coverage revealed that Shannon, Simpson and Pielou's diversity indices' values did not considerably change up to 30% of R. alpinus coverage, but a further increase in R. alpinus coverage led to a steep decline in diversity. There was exception in a number of species per plot, which decreased steadily along with the increase of R. alpinus coverage. Multivariate analysis indicated a significant shift in the composition of invaded plots in relation to uninvaded plots, resulting from the shared increase of more shadow-tolerant and higher soil base-, nutrient- and moist-demanding species.

AB  - Volunteers are increasingly involved in the delivery of nature conservation policies, usually supported by a twofold rationale: volunteering can (a) enhance citizen participation in environmental governance and (b) ensure a workforce is in place to support conservation work in times of budget shortages. Here, we ask how these two rationales correspond to volunteers' own motivations to engage in a specific nature conservation activity, namely the control of invasive alien species (IAS). We use qualitative interviews with professional project managers, local group leaders, and volunteers to examine the interactions between policies aiming to rationalise the management of IAS and the motivations for and goals of volunteer engagement. Our findings suggest that although volunteering can lead to positive conservation outcomes, satisfying experiences and empowerment, the different interests do not always align in practice. We investigate the implications of strategies that aim to improve the efficiency of invasive species and volunteer management, and discuss organisational arrangements that reconcile different objectives.

T2  - Journal of Soils and Sediments
AB  - PurposeA monitoring investigation undertaken along the River Ibach, northwest Switzerland over the winter 2012/2013, found that riparian areas recently supporting the invasive plant Himalayan Balsam (HB) recorded significantly higher erosion rates than nearby uninvaded areas. This communication sythesises the latest findings about the influence of HB on sedimentation processes, again, from the Ibach, but also from a second river system in southwest UK.Materials and methodsErosion pins, a micro-profile bridge and a digital caliper were used to measure changes in soil surface profile (SSP) at selected riparian areas supporting HB plants along both rivers. Values were statistically compared against equivalent data recorded from nearby reference areas supporting mixed perennial vegetation. A comparison of source and sediment geochemistry was also undertaken on soil from HB-invaded and uninvaded floodplain areas along the Ibach, to assess the potential for identifying the extent to which either group acts as a sediment source.Results and discussionErosion pin data indicate that soil loss from HB-colonised areas was significantly greater than soil loss from reference areas in two out of the four periods at the River Ibach site, and in two out of three measurement periods at the River Taw site. Colonisation of new HB sites may initially occur by hydrochorous processes, but HB plants may increase colonisation potential by trapping additional fine sediment and organic matter, including viable HB seeds. Geochemical results from the Ibach suggest that high inputs of suspended sediment originate from sources close to the river channel, but HB-invaded floodplain sources have geochemical properties that are most similar to suspended river sediment.ConclusionsThe findings from both rivers led us to rethink our original hypothesis; that HB promotes soil erosion, to an amended hypothesis in which HB may be associated with areas where high erosion is sometimes recorded. Whilst initial colonisation may be due to hydrochorous processes, as HB becomes increasingly established, the displacement of perennial vegetation increases the risk of erosion during the winter period when live HB plants are absent. Preliminary geochemical findings of floodplain soils supporting different vegetation types along the Ibach tentatively suggest that at least some material originating from HB sites may enter the watercourse.

AB  - Background Impacts of invasive species on native communities are often difficult to assess, because they depend on a range of factors, such as species identity and traits. Such context-dependencies are poorly understood yet, but knowledge is required to predict the impact of invasions. Materials and methods We assessed species- and developmental stage-specificity of competitive and allelopathic effects of the invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera on different developmental stages of four native plant species. While some studies have shown a reduction in plant growth caused by I. glandulifera, the magnitude of its impact is ambiguous. For our study we used seedlings and juveniles of I. glandulifera and the native target species Geum urbanum, Filipendula ulmaria, Urtica dioica, and Salix fragilis (seedlings only of the latter), which often co-occur with I. glandulifera in different habitats. Plants were grown in competition with I. glandulifera or treated with I. glandulifera leaf material, or 2-metoxy-1,4-naphtoquinone (2-MNQ), its supposedly main allelochemical. Results and conclusion Overall I. glandulifera had a negative effect on the growth of all target species depending on the species and on the plant's developmental stage. F. ulmaria was the least affected and U. dioica the most, and seedlings were less affected than juveniles. The species-specific response to I. glandulifera may lead to an altered community composition in the field, while growth reduction of seedlings and juveniles should give I. glandulifera an advantage in cases where plant recruitment is crucial. 2-MNQ led to minor reductions in plant growth, suggesting that it may not be the only allelopathic substance of I. glandulifera. Surprisingly, I. glandulifera was not fully tolerant to 2-MNQ. This autotoxicity could contribute to I. glandulifera population dynamics. We conclude that I. glandulifera reduces the growth of native vegetation and alters early successional stages without fully hindering it.

T2  - Plant Methods
AB  - BackgroundProtein-containing samples can readily be characterised and/or identified using matrix-assisted laser-desorption and ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). This technique however requires relatively-fresh biological material that contains proteins that have not yet undergone significant degradation. For field-work collection of samples, problems are often encountered due to delays between collection and sample processing, sample storage (possibly at elevated temperature and/or humidity in some climates), quarantine/regulatory restrictions on the transfer of living biological materials across national borders, and the potential to transfer unwanted microorganisms via non-living biological materials.ResultsIn an attempt to overcome the above difficulties, we have developed a simple and inexpensive method for practical storage of field-sample proteins, for subsequent MALDI-TOF MS analysis, in which biological material is crushed onto filter paper and dried. The dried and protein-impregnated filter paper can then be soaked in an alcoholic solution suitable for the inactivation of microorganisms of concern and again dried for storage. After subsequent dry storage, the proteins may be eluted from the paper using a solution containing acetonitrile, trifluoroacetic acid, water, and MALDI-TOF MS matrix near to saturation. The extracted proteins are then pipetted onto the MALDI-TOF MS sample plate for subsequent analysis. Using this method, spectra of comparable quality to fresh-material controls have been obtained for acid-soluble proteins from Fallopia japonica and Impatiens glandulifera leaf material. Unlike untreated leaf material, high-quality spectra can be obtained with and without alcohol treatment even after storage for one month at up to 40 degrees C.ConclusionsWe have developed a simple and inexpensive method for practical storage of field-sample proteins for subsequent MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Key benefits of this approach are a reduction in sample degradation, and consequent conservation of taxon-discriminatory spectral profiles, whilst minimising the potential for carryover of viable microorganisms.

T2  - Plant Ecology
AB  - Although closely related, Impatiens glandulifera and Impatiens balfourii differ in their invasiveness in Europe; only the former is highly invasive there. Following the assumptions of the enemy release hypothesis (ERH), we tested whether these differences may be explained by the levels of seed infestation by pathogenic fungi. Using seeds collected along the Swiss-Italian border, we recorded four true pathogens of seeds: Fusarium culmorum, F. oxysporum, F. sporotrichoides, and Giberella avenacea. In Italy the seeds of I. balfourii were infected by fungal pathogens more often than those of I. glandulifera, while in Switzerland both species were under the same level of pressure. However, the overall differences in pathogen abundance were consistent with the ERH: seeds of the more invasive species were attacked less. This could be a result of differences between the communities of fungal pathogens attacking the seeds of both species in each country. The number of colonies of secondary pathogens (Cladosporium cladosporioides, Alternaria alternata) correlated negatively with the number of colonies of true pathogens; we suggest that the secondary pathogens may have prevented the occurrence of the true pathogens. The reason for the between-country differences in the fungal pathogen communities is unclear. A possible explanation is that Italy and Switzerland differ in their road and green-area maintenance work schemes, which may have influenced pathogen pressure on seeds. This study is one of the few that offers results indicating that release from enemies may be crucial to the invasion success of plants as early as the seed stage.

AB  - Rivers with a natural flooding regime and gravel accumulations are an important natural habitat endangered by regulations and other types of human impact. Succession after disturbances by floods creates a mosaic of different vegetation types, some of them containing rare specialist species. We studied vegetation succession and changes in plant diversity on river gravel bars of four streams in the Western Carpathians and their foothills in the eastern Czech Republic. This area experienced extreme 50-year flood event in May 2010. Gravel bar vegetation was destroyed, some of the former bars were covered by sediments, and some new bars arose. We sampled gravel bar vegetation two months after the floods and repeated the sampling on each site during the next three years. Initial vegetation has developed through a sparse and species-rich stage into denser stands with more shade-tolerant species. In the fourth year, tall herbs, such as Urtica dioica, Phalaris arundinacea and the alien Impatiens glandulifera, dominated the communities, but shrub vegetation started to develop only in a few places. Species capable of vegetative dispersal prevailed over species dispersed by seeds only. Altitude and size of gravel/stone particles were identified as important factors affecting vegetation succession. The succession ran faster on gravelly substrates at lower altitudes than on stony substrates at higher altitudes. Although the studied streams are partly influenced by human interventions and host only few gravel bar specialists, they are of considerable conservation importance.

AB  - This study determined the total phenolics content in various plant parts of invasive Impatiens species and evaluate their phytotoxicity on germination and seedling growth of wheat (Triticum aestium L.) 'Hamlet'(monocot) and rapeseed (Brasica rapus L.) 'Cult'(dicot). In 2016, the allelopathic activity of two invasive Impatiens species (Balsaminaceae) viz., balsam [ I. parviflora (origin C. Asia)] and Himalayan balsam [I. glandulifera (origin Himalayas)] was assessed on seed germination of wheat and rapeseed ex situ. In Impatiens extracts phenolics content ranged between 0.001 and 0.008 mg g(-1) and these significantly inhibited the seed germination and seedling growth of both recipient species. However, germination inhibition differed for each recipient specie. Both Impatiens spp. extracts drastically inhibited the rapeseed germination (4.5-81%) than wheat germination (62-86.5%) possibly due to different seed coat anatomy and thus, its permeability. Therefore the most drastic inhibition (90% and 86.5%) was recorded in rapeseed germination (4.5% and 11.5%) in 0.2% flower and fruit+seed extract of I. parviflora and I. glandulifera, respectively. Consequently, recruitment and regeneration of native species might be negatively affected by the invasive Impatiens species in invaded habitats.

AB  - Background: Matrix-assisted laser-desorption and ionisation time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) is a powerful tool for the characterisation and/or identification of protein-containing samples. Several MALDI-TOF MS sample-preparation methods are currently available but few of these are well suited to the analysis of plant material. We have recently developed a simple, rapid, and relatively-cheap method for MALDI-TOF MS that is applicable to plant material (in addition to microbial and insect material), and our aim in this study was to distinguish between closely-related plant species and/or between regional biotypes within an invasive weed species using this method with a view to optimising the selection of biological control agents that can be used for weed management. Results: We have employed a combination of principal-component analysis and closest-relatedness diagrams derived from MALDI-TOF MS spectral-comparison data to discriminate between the closely-related Impatiens spp. Impatiens noli-tangere, Impatiens parviflora, Impatiens scabrida, Impatiens balsamina, and two regional biotypes of the invasive weed Impatiens glandulifera. We have also developed a method for sample discrimination based upon comparison between blind-test MALDI-TOF MS spectra and reference- sample spectra. Using this latter method, we have been able to discriminate on the basis of the acid-soluble-protein mass spectra generated between four regional biotypes of I. glandulifera that differ in their susceptibility to the biological control agent Himalayan balsam rust (Puccinia komarovii var. glanduliferae) using mature leaf material. Using younger leaves, discrimination was not possible between these four regional biotypes. Conclusions: MALDI-TOF MS analysis is able to discriminate between closely-related plant species within the genus Impatiens and between regional biotypes of I. glandulifera. Because of this, MALDI-TOF MS holds great promise for improving weed biological control, a management technique which uses highly-specific co-evolved natural enemies for the control of an invasive non-native plant species, through the optimal matching of biological control agents with susceptible target species/regional biotypes.

AB  - The plants of the Impatiens L. (Balsaminaceae) have been used for a long time in folk medicine in different painful conditions, and to treat rheumatism, isthmus and crural aches, fractures, superficial infections, fingernail inflammation. This study was undertaken to detemiine the pharmacological profile of hydroethanolic extracts from Impatiens glandulifera, I. noli-tangere and I. parviflora. A range of behavioral assessments was applied to evaluate the effects of obtained extracts i.e. measurement of body temperature. tests of locomotor activity and motor coordination. nociceptive reaction and anxiety-like behavior. Hydroethanolic extracts were analysed for total polyphenol (TPC), flavonoid (TFC), flavones/flavonols (TFFC). and flavonones/dihydroflavonols (TFDC) content. Our results show that the extracts from Impatiens species contain high levels of TPC, TFC. TFFC, and TFDC. Oral (i.e., by gavage) administration of Impatiens L. extracts (except for I. nolitangere) presented an antinociceptive or/and anti-inflammatory activity in the writhing test. The antinociceptive effect of I. parviflora leaves (100 mg/kg) and I. glandulifera flowers (100 mg/kg) was reversed by naloxone. I. glandulifera flowers and roots extracts (100 mg/kg) increased the reaction time to the thermal stimulus in the hot-plate test. All extracts from I. glandulifera (100 mg/kg) showed antianxiety effect in the elevated plus-maze test. It is worth noting that none of the extracts, at the highest used dose - 0.1 ED50 (200 mg/kg), caused coordination impairments or myorelaxation as measured in the rota-rod and chimney tests. These results seem to suggest that the tested extracts are not neurotoxic. These findings show the potential use of hydroethanolic extracts from different parts of I. glandulifera as phytomedicine.

AB  - The chemical composition of the lipophilic fractions of Impatiens glandulifera Royle and I. noli-tangere L. were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)., The study focused on the fatty acids, triterpenoids and sterols in the leaves, roots and seeds. Most of the identified compounds are new for these species. a-linolenic, oleic and palmitic acids were the most abundant in the fatty acid fractions, beta-amyrin and 5 alpha-lup-20(29)-en-3 beta-ol in the triterpenoid fractious, and P-sitosterol, spinasterol and chondrillasterol in the sterol fractions. The fatty acid and triterpenoid fractions showed strong antioxidant activity, similar to positive controls. Moreover, the triterpenoid fraction from I. noli-tangere seeds significantly inhibited HL-60 human leukemia cells. Other fractions showed moderate cytotoxicity. The present study suggests that I. glandulifera and L noli-tangere are good source of omega-3 fatty acids, and they might be considered as antioxidant and chemopreventive agents.

AB  - No studies have compared so far the effects of alien invasive and expansive native (widespread, mono-dominant) plants on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Four global or European most successful invaders (Impatiens glandulifera, Reynoutria japonica, Rudbeckia laciniata, Solidago gigantea) and two expansive plants native to Europe (Artemisia vulgaris, Phalaris arundinacea) were grown in pots to elucidate the magnitude and direction of changes in AMF abundance, species richness, and species composition in soils from under multispecies native vegetation. In a second stage, the effects of these changes on a native plant, Plantago lanceolata, were assessed. Plant species identity had larger impact on AMF abundance, species richness, and species composition as well as on P. lanceolata than origin of the species (alien vs. native). This could be due to the character of AMF relationships with the plants, i.e., their mycorrhizal status and dependency on AMF. However, the alterations induced by the plant species in soil chemical properties rather than in AMF community were the major drivers of differences in shoot mass and photosynthetic performance of P. lanceolata. We determined that the plants produced species-specific effects on soil properties that, in turn, resulted in species-specific soil feedbacks on the native plant. These effects were not consistent within groups of invaders or natives.

AB  - As anthropogenic pressure on the landscape increases, invasive alien species (IAS) pose a growing threat to areas designed to protect high biodiversity habitats. In order to assess the present danger of IAS spread, we examined 23 Czech sites of community importance (SCI) within Natura 2000 protected areas (PA) over 2015 and mapped the occurrence of four IAS: Solidago spp. (goldenrod), Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam), Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed) and Fallopia spp. (Japanese knotweed). The model areas were divided into five monitoring zones, graded by conservation importance and habitat disturbance level (core area [A], broader core area [B], semi-natural habitat [C], anthropogenically affected habitat [D], anthropogenically degraded habitat [E]). Despite a high number of IAS occurrences (3222 localities), habitats of European importance (zone A) showed a relatively low level of invasion (< 0.3% total area). Highest IAS occurrence number was in SCI border areas and disturbed habitats (zones C and E). There was a significant positive correlation between level of invasion inside and outside SCIs, related to human activities such as logging and urbanisation. A strong effect for watercourse vicinity was noted for the occurrence of I. glandulifera and Fallopia spp.; but not for H. mantegazzianum and Solidago spp. A stratified management approach, employing zones delimitation to assess what threat pose IAS to the PA objects of conservation, can be useful to prioritize control measures in IAS local action plans.

AB  - Invasive alien plants threaten biodiversity, ecosystems and service provision worldwide. They can have positive and negative direct and indirect effects on herbivorous insects, including those that provide pollination services. Here, we quantify how three highly invasive plant species (Heracleum mantegazzianum, Impatiens glandulifera and Fallopia japonica) influence the availability of floral resources and flower-visiting insect communities. We compared invaded with comparable uninvaded areas to assess floral resources and used pan-trapping to quantify insect communities. Only F. japonica influenced floral resource availability: sites invaded by this species had a higher flowering plant species richness and abundance of open floral units than uninvaded sites, probably due to its late flowering and the paucity of other flowering species at this time of year. Fallopia japonica was also associated with higher abundances of bumblebees, higher overall insect diversity and higher hoverfly diversity than uninvaded areas. Differences in pollinator communities were also associated with I. glandulifera and H. mantegazzianum, despite there being no detectable differences in floral resources at these sites. Specifically, there were more bumblebees and solitary bees in I. glandulifera sites, and a higher overall diversity of insects, particularly hoverflies. By contrast, H. mantegazzianum sites had a lower abundance of solitary bees and hoverflies. These findings confirm that invasive plant species have a range of species-specific effects on ecological communities. This supports the emerging view that control of invasive species, as required under international obligations, is not simple and that potential losses and gains for biodiversity must be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

AB  - Biological control of weeds is a globally recognised approach to the management of some of the most troublesome invasive plants in the world. Accidental introductions of agents accounted for all weed biological control agent establishments in the European Union until 2010, but these examples include some current or emerging control successes both large and small, from the redistribution of the weevil Stenopelmus rufinasus Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) for the control of small outbreaks of Azolla filiculoides Lam. (Azollaceae), to the large scale control provided by the cochineal insect Dactylopius opuntiae (Cockerell) (Hemiptera: Dactylopiidae), used against some problematic prickly pears (Opuntia spp. (Cactaceae)), and the ragweed beetle Ophraella communa LeSage (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), against common ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. (Asteraceae), which are providing benefits to an increasing number of Member States of the European Union. Recent programmes involving the intentional introduction of biological control agents against target weeds including Fallopia japonica (Hout.) Ronse Decr. (Polygonaceae), Impatiens glandulifera Royle (Balsaminaceae) and Acacia longifolia (Andrews) Willd (Fabaceae) show a shift from luck to judgement in the European Union. The inclusion of new weed targets on the European Invasive Species Regulation should lead to a growth in the profile and use of biological control which would be assisted by the publication of any successes from the few intentional introductions covered in this paper.

AU  - Pattison, Zarah
AU  - Whytock, Robin

T2  - Biological Invasions
AB  - Riparian zones are formed by interactions between fluvio-geomorphological processes, such as sediment deposition, and biota, such as vegetation. Establishment of invasive alien plant (IAP) species along rivers may influence vegetation dynamics, evidenced as higher seasonal or inter-annual fluctuations in native plant diversity when IAP cover is high. This could impact the overall functioning of riparian ecosystems. Conversely, fine sediment deposited in riparian zones after floods may replenish propagule banks, thus supporting recruitment of native species. The interactive effects of invasion and fine sediment deposition have hitherto, however, been ignored. Vegetation surveys across rivers varying in flow regime were carried out over 2 years to assess changes in community composition and diversity. Artificial turf mats were used to quantify over-winter sediment deposition. The viable propagule bank in soil and freshly deposited sediment was then quantified by germination trials. Structural Equation Models were used to assess causal pathways between environmental variables, IAPs and native vegetation. Greater variation in flow increased the cover of IAPs along riverbanks. An increased in high flow events and sediment deposition were positively associated with the diversity of propagules deposited. However, greater diversity of propagules did not result in a more diverse plant community at invaded sites, as greater cover of IAPs in summer reduced native plant diversity. Seasonal turnover in the above-ground vegetation was also accentuated at previously invaded sites, suggesting that a legacy of increased competition in previous years, not recent sediment deposition, drives above-ground vegetation structure at invaded sites. The interaction between fluvial disturbance via sediment deposition and invasion pressure is of growing importance in the management of riparian habitats. Our results suggest that invasion can uncouple the processes that contribute to resilience in dynamic habitats making already invaded habitats vulnerable to further invasions.

AB  - This study compared the effects of four invasive plants, namely Impatiens glandulifera, Reynoutria japonica, Rudbeckia laciniata, and Solidago gigantea, as well as two native species-Artemisia vulgaris, Phalaris arundinacea, and their mixture on soil physicochemical properties in a pot experiment. Plants were planted in pots in two loamy sand soils. The soils were collected from fallows located outside (fallow soil) and within river valley (valley soil) under native plant communities. Aboveground plant biomass, cover, and soil physicochemical properties such as nutrient concentrations, pH, and water holding capacity (WHC) were measured after two growing seasons. Discriminant analysis (DA) was used to identify soil variables responsible for the discrimination between plant treatments. Identified variables were further compared between treatments using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD test. Plant biomass, cover, and soil parameters depended on species and soil type. DA effectively separated soils under different plant species. DA on fallow soil data separated R. laciniata from all other treatments, especially I. glandulifera, native species and bare soil, along axis 1 (related mainly to exchangeable K, N-NH4, total P, N-NO3, and WHC). Large differences were found between R. laciniata and S. gigantea as indicated by axis 2 (S-SO4, exchangeable Mg, total P, exchangeable Ca, and total Mg). DA on valley soil data separated R. japonica from all other treatments, particularly S. gigantea, R. laciniata, and native mixture, along axis 1 (N-NO3, total N, S-SO4, total P, pH). Along axis 2 (N-NO3, N-NH4, Olsen P, exchangeable K, WHC), large differences were observed between I. glandulifera and all other invaders. Plant influence on soil differed both among invasive species and between invasive and native species. Impatiens glandulifera had a relatively weak effect and its soil was similar to both native and bare soils. Multidirectional effects of different invaders resulted in a considerable divergence in soil characteristics. Invasion-driven changes in the soil environment may trigger feedbacks that stabilize or accelerate invasion and hinder re-colonization by native vegetation, which has implications for the restoration of invaded habitats.

AB  - Biological invasions entail massive biodiversity losses and tremendous economic impacts that justify significant management efforts. Because the funds available to control biological invasions are limited, there is a need to identify priority species. In this paper, we first review current invasive species prioritization methods and explicitly highlight their strengths and pitfalls. We then construct a cost-benefit optimization framework that offers the theoretical foundations of a simple method for the management of multiple invasive species under a limited budget. We provide an algorithm to operationalize this framework and render explicit the assumptions required to satisfy the management objective.

AB  - Questions: Predicting when invasive species will affect ecosystem functioning remains problematic, with strong contingency upon both the invasive species and the recipient community's identities. Adopting a functional trait-based approach might overcome this context-dependence. As an early exploration of this approach, we used a greenhouse experiment with seeds of the invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera to assess the potential invasion effects on community trait composition and biomass production. Location: Three distant European seed origins, northern France, southern Sweden and central Norway, into transplanted turves from Trondheim, Norway. Methods: At the end of the greenhouse experiment, we measured plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and standing biomass of both the invasive plant and the turf communities. With these data we evaluated invasion effects on community trait composition and standing biomass (as a first test of ecosystem function effects), including dependence on invasive species origin and recipient community composition. Results: Invasion by I. glandulifera introduced divergent trait values (high plant height and SLA, low LDMC) to the recipient community. The trait set of both the invader and, to a lesser extent, the community were altered following invasion, seemingly driven by increased light competition. Competitive and graminoid-dominated communities showed stronger changes in LDMC following invasion. Functional traits of both the communities and the invasive species helped explain the increase in standing biomass. Southern invader plants more strongly affected the recipient community than their northern counterparts, resulting in stronger biomass reduction of the recipient community. Conclusions: This study shows how invasion-induced increases in productivity are effectuated through both the introduction of different invader traits and shifts in the co-occurring species trait set, illustrating the potential of a functional trait-based approach.

AB  - Invasive plants may severely impact native biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We examined potential effects of the invasive annual plant Impatiens glandulifera Royle on soil fungal and bacterial communities in temperate forests. Using a space-for-time approach, we established 72 plots in forest areas invaded by I. glandulifera and in forest areas, which were not yet invaded, equally distributed over three coniferous and three deciduous forests. In each plot, we determined plant species richness and abundance in the above-ground vegetation as well as the diversity and composition of the soil fungal community using T-RFLP analysis. Biolog Ecoplates were used to assess the activity of soil bacteria. The invasion of I. glandulifera caused significant shifts in plant species composition. Invaded plots were characterized by a higher diversity and an altered composition of the soil fungal community and by a lower soil bacterial activity in late spring. Carbon substrate utilization patterns of soil bacteria were also changed in invaded plots. Our experiment shows that I. glandulifera can modify soil fungal and bacterial communities, indicating an indirect effect of altered soil properties induced by the invasive plant, combined with the release of allelopathic compounds into the soil.

AB  - Even though temperate forests have lower non-native plant species richness and cover in comparison to some other habitats, such as anthropogenically influenced habitats or some grassland habitats, several recent studies from Central Europe suggest that there has been an increase in the numbers and proportions of non-native species in forests. Previous studies on the level of invasion in forest habitats were usually conducted on a relatively coarse scale, often excluding plantations of non-native trees or analyzing them together as a group regardless of the different biological properties of different species. Therefore, a more detailed analysis would be helpful to obtain better insight into the processes taking place in forests, focusing not only on the analysis of the invasion level of different forest types at a finer scale (e.g., in various types of floodplain, beech or coniferous) but also on the character of the non-native plants found there (invasive status, frequencies and habitat preferences). In this study, we aimed to (i) compare the invasion level of various forest habitats (including forests dominated by non-native trees) in Slovakia with regard to different residence times and invasive status of nonnative species, (ii) analyze whether forest habitats possess specific non-native species combinations, and (iii) determine the preferences of non-native plants with respect to specific forest habitats and the co-occurrence of other plant species with the most frequent non-native species. Our study confirmed that almost all forest habitats contained at least one non-native species. Native forests at lower elevations and closer to rivers were more invaded, while broadleaved, mixed and especially coniferous forests at higher elevations and ecologically strictly limited forests were less (or un-) invaded. Significant differences between various types of riparian and coniferous forests, emphasized the importance of the more detailed discrimination of the forest habitats in comparison with previous studies. Non-native tree plantations, which are among the most invaded forests, also deserve special attention. Some non-native trees form stable communities with typical native and non-native species, where non-native dominants can act as drivers of further changes in the vegetation composition, facilitating spread of other co-occurring non-native shrubs and herbs. Taking into consideration the potential negative impacts of some non-native plants on species composition, forest microclimate and soil chemistry, it would be advisable for foresters to factor this into forest management because their choice of planted species may both positively and negatively influence the level of invasion in managed forests.

The method of Zurich-Montpelier school (BRAUN-BLANQUET 1964) was applied for phytocoenological releves, and the results were compared with the results of JURKO (1958) obtained almost 60 years ago. Invasive plant species spread across the Dunajske ostrovy Nature Reserve, a part of the Dunajske luhy Protected Landscape Area (PLA) Dunajske luhy. In addition to invasive tree species Ailanthus altissima and Negundo aceroides, invasive taxa Impatiens glandulifera was also recorded in the study area. Association Fraxino-Populetum was determined in the area. On the basis of the ecological analysis with the help of the indicated ecological factors according to Ellenberg (1979), statistically significant humidity factor was found. Shannon index, temperature, continentality, soil reaction, soil nitrogen and light were found as passive gradients of the environment. On the basis of the eco-index values the vegetation community was characterized as mesophilic, growing on fresh, moderately humid soils. The soil type and subtype were determined as fluvisol modal.

AB  - Invasive alien plant effects on ecosystem functions are often difficult to predict across environmental gradients due to the context-dependent interactions between the invader and the recipient communities. Adopting a functional trait-based framework could provide more mechanistic predictions for invasive species' impacts. In this study, we contrast litter decomposition rates among communities with and without the invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera in five regions along a 1600 km long latitudinal gradient in Europe. Across this gradient, four functional traits, namely leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area (SLA), stem-specific density (SSD), and plant height, are correlated to rates of litter decomposition of standardized rooibos (labile), green tea (recalcitrant), and I. glandulifera litter. Our results show that both invaded and non-invaded plant communities had a higher expression of acquisitive traits (low LDMC and SSD, high SLA) with increasing temperature along the latitudinal gradient, partly explaining the variation in decomposition rates along the gradient. At the same time, invasion shifted community trait composition toward more acquisitive traits across the latitudinal gradient. These trait changes partly explained the increased litter decomposition rates of the labile litter fraction of rooibos and I. glandulifera litter in invaded communities, a shift that was most evident in the warmer study regions. Plant available nitrogen was lower in invaded communities, likely due to high nutrient uptake by I. glandulifera. Meanwhile, the coldest study region was characterized by a reversed effect of invasion on decomposition rates. Here, community traits related to low litter quality and potential allelopathic effects of the invader resulted in reduced litter decomposition rates, suggesting a threshold temperature at which invader effects on litter decomposition turn positive. This study therefore illustrates how functional trait changes toward acquisitive traits can help explain invader-induced changes in ecosystem functions such as increased litter decomposition.

AB  - Background: The importance of intraspecific trait variation (ITV) is increasingly acknowledged among plant ecologists. However, our understanding of what drives ITV between individual plants (ITVBI) at the population level is still limited. Contrasting theoretical hypotheses state that ITVBI can be either suppressed (stress-reduced plasticity hypothesis) or enhanced (stress-induced variability hypothesis) under high abiotic stress. Similarly, other hypotheses predict either suppressed (niche packing hypothesis) or enhanced ITVBI (individual variation hypothesis) under high niche packing in species rich communities. In this study we assess the relative effects of both abiotic and biotic niche effects on ITVBI of four functional traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, plant height and seed mass), for three herbaceous plant species across a 2300 km long gradient in Europe. The study species were the slow colonizing Anemone nemorosa, a species with intermediate colonization rates, Milium effusum, and the fast colonizing, non-native Impatiens glandulifera. Results: Climatic stress consistently increased ITVBI across species and traits. Soil nutrient stress, on the other hand, reduced ITVBI for A. nemorosa and I. glandulifera, but had a reversed effect for M. effusum. We furthermore observed a reversed effect of high niche packing on ITVBI for the fast colonizing non-native I. glandulifera (increased ITVBI), as compared to the slow colonizing native A. nemorosa and M. effusum (reduced ITVBI). Additionally, ITVBI in the fast colonizing species tended to be highest for the vegetative traits plant height and leaf area, but lowest for the measured generative trait seed mass. Conclusions: This study shows that stress can both reduce and increase ITVBI, seemingly supporting both the stress-reduced plasticity and stress-induced variability hypotheses. Similarly, niche packing effects on ITVBI supported both the niche packing hypothesis and the individual variation hypothesis. These results clearly illustrates the importance of simultaneously evaluating both abiotic and biotic factors on ITVBI. This study adds to the growing realization that within-population trait variation should not be ignored and can provide valuable ecological insights.

AB  - Background and purpose: The objectives of our study were to identify invasive alien plant species (IAS) in the main Natura 2000 forest habitat types (FHT) along the Mura River in Slovenia, and to estimate their abundance and cover. The aim of our study was to find out a) Which IAS appear in the research forests? b) What is their frequency and cover percentage? c) Whether individual IAS prosper better in some FHT than others? d) What is the correlation between the cover of IAS and the tree layer cover? Materials and methods: We analysed the fidelity of invasive plant species to individual FHT. The studied FHTs along the Mura River were the following: 91E0* (Alluvial forests with Alnus glutinosa and Fraxinus excelsior), 91F0 (Riparian mixed forests of Quercus robur, Ulmus laevis and Ulmus minor, Fraxinus excelsior or Fraxinus angustifolia, along the great rivers) and 91L0 (Illyrian oak-hornbeam forests). Two forest areas of about 600 ha were studied in total. With the intention to calculate number and cover of IAS some statistical analysis was made. In addition, correlations between the abundances of the most present IAS and cover of upper tree layer were carried out. Results: In total, 15 IAS were recorded in studied FHTs. Some species, like Robinia pseudoacacia, Impatiens glandulifera, I. parviflora, Fallopia japonica (incl. F. x bohemica), Erigeron annuus, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Amorpha fruticosa, Conyza canadensis and Juncus tenuis occur only in one or two FHTs, while some species can be found in all studied FHTs (e.g. Solidago sp.). We found out that the most threatened forests are those with prevailing Salix alba, Alnus glutinosa, Fraxinus angustifolia and Ulmus laevis tree species. Those are the forests of FHT 91E0 which have less dense tree canopies, grow closest to the river and on the wettest sites. We found a statistically significant higher number and cover of IAS in the FHT 91E0 and the lowest number and cover in FHT 91L0. Conclusions: Alluvial forests with Alnus glutinosa and Fraxinus excelsior (FHT 91E0) along the Mura River are most prone to invasion of IAS. The increasing presence of IAS in the study areas seriously affects natural regeneration, stability, and continuity of floodplain forests in all other FHTs in the study area. At the same time the amount of IAS in these forests also depends on management measures and their intensities which accelerate light availability. Some measures and guidelines for managing of these forests with the purpose of reducing IAS impacts are suggested in this study.

AB  - Background: This explorative study was undertaken for the first time in Kel village located in the Upper Neelum Valley, Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. The purpose was to document the indigenous knowledge of the native people used in the preparation of herbal medicines. Methods: To get the data on traditional uses of medicinal plants, 20 informants were interviewed. Quantitative ethnobotanical indices, i.e., use value (UV), relative frequencies of citation (RFC), informant consensus factor (Fic), fidelity level (FL), data matrix ranking (DMR), preference ranking (PR), and jaccard index (JI), were calculated for the recorded medicinal plants. Results: A total of 50 medicinal plants belonging to 33 families used in 13 disease categories were documented. Leaves were the frequently used plant parts, and decoction was the commonly used method for herbal medicine. Plants with high use value were Berberis lycium (2.05), Impatiens glandulifera (1.95), Artemisia scoparia (1.75), Ageratum conozoides (1.75), and Achillea millefolium (1.7). The highest RFC value was calculated for Berberis lycium (0.75), Cynoglossum lanceolatum (0.65), and Impatiens glandulifera and Achillea millefolium (0.60 each). The maximum informant consensus factor was for urinary system, cardiac diseases, baldness, and abortion and miscarriage (1.00). Berberis lyceum (95%) used in jaundice, hepatitis, typhoid, fever, and tuberculosis disorders. Plants with maximum fidelity level (FL) were Berberis lycium (95%) followed by Dioscorea bulbifera, Impatiens glandulifera, and Artemisia vulgaris (90%). Olea ferruginea was the most multipurpose plant and exports (21.2%) was the leading threat in the area. The pearson correlation coefficient (0.500) showed a positive correlation between the use value and relative frequency of citation. Conclusion: The present study provides useful information about traditional uses of medicinal plants used by local communities in different ailments. The plants with the highest use values could be employed in pharmacological research and biotechnological approaches in order to achieve adequate revenue. Some of the plants in the study area are facing high threats of becoming rare, and conservation initiatives are needed to conserve them for sustainable management in the region.

T2  - Biological Invasions
AB  - Management of invasive species often raises substantial conflicts of interest. Since such conflicts can hamper proposed management actions, managers, decision makers and researchers increasingly recognize the need to consider the social dimensions of invasive species management. In this exploratory study, we aimed (1) to explore whether species' taxonomic position (i.e. animals vs. plants) and type of invaded landscape (i.e. urban vs. non-urban) might influence public perception about the management of invasive species, and (2) to assess the potential of public awareness to increase public support for invasive species management. We reviewed the scientific literature on the conflicts of interest around the management of alien species and administered two-phased questionnaires (before and after providing information on the target species and its management) to members of the public in South Africa and the UK (n = 240). Our review suggests that lack of public support for the management of invasive animals in both urban and non-urban areas derives mainly from moralistic value disagreements, while the management of invasive plants in non-urban areas mostly causes conflicts based on utilitarian value disagreements. Despite these general trends, conflicts are context dependent and can originate from a wide variety of different views. Notably, informing the public about the invasive status and negative impacts of the species targeted for management appeared to increase public support for the management actions. Therefore, our results align with the view that increased public awareness might increase the public support for the management of invasive species, independent of taxonomic position and type of landscape.

AB  - Parthenium hysterophorus L. (Asteraceae) is an annual weed of worldwide significance in grasslands and riparian corridors. In view of the invasibility and known allelochemical properties exhibited by its presence in a given habitat, the weed is hypothesized to change soil properties significantly. Soil samples were collected in Parthenium weed invaded and non-invaded vegetation patches over two years and across twelve sites in central and south east Queensland of three land-use types, and analyzed for differences in physicochemical and biotic contents. Soil response to the weed invasion varied significantly between years, regions, sites, and land-use types (riparian corridor > grazing grassland cropping land), but invasion impact was minimal. Overall, there was a tendency for increased soil major nutrients and microbial traits with Parthenium weed invasion. However, the differences, using conventional parametric statistics and bias-corrected Hedges' effect size procedures were non-significant - due to a lack of consistency in the direction or magnitude of the impact. In five sites, the 95% confidence intervals of mean impact of the effect size estimates spanned both the null and the rejection regions, indicating data insensitivity. Only in one site was the null hypothesis upheld, while for the remaining six sites, there was evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no invasion impact, but direction varied significantly. Impact of Parthenium weed invasion on soil processes is context and trait-of interest-dependent, and the magnitude and/or direction of the weed invasion is affected by complex interactions among environmental factors that might change across invaded habitats and survey periods, making broad generalizations un-informative for management.

AB  - Forests understories in Europe are known to generally resist invasion, though some alien plants do invade woodland communities. Here we focused on the impact of the widespread invasive annual Impatiens glandulifera, common along watercourses, but recently spreading in forests up to timberline. We investigated its impact on plant-soil feedback and ecosystem functioning. We recorded >40 variables focusing on: soil characteristics, including micro- and macro-nutrients; characteristics of litter layer and enzyme activity in litter; and richness and species composition of the forest understory. Three treatments were followed for 3 years: plots invaded by I. glandulifera; adjacent invader removal plots within the invaded area; and spatially separated uninvaded plots outside the invaded area. The effect of year-to-year variation was generally greater than that of the treatments, especially in soil and litter characteristics. Copper and boron were higher in invaded than invader removal and uninvaded plots, though in quantities that are unlikely to harm other plants. We found no effect of I. glandulifera on litter characteristics or enzyme activity. Despite almost 80% cover of I. glandulifera, we did not detect any difference in species richness and total vegetation cover between invaded and uninvaded plots. The floristic composition differed among the uninvaded, invader removal and invaded plots across 3 years. Our results indicate that the effect of I. glandulifera on the forest community studied was minor, and largely resulted from its increased shading to other plant species. In conclusion, we show how misleading the evaluation of impacts can be if based on a single season.

AB  - Invasive alien plant species negatively impact native plant communities by out-competing species or changing abiotic and biotic conditions in their introduced range. River systems are especially vulnerable to biological invasions, because waterways can function as invasion corridors. Understanding interactions of invasive and native species and their combined effects on river dynamics is essential for developing cost-effective management strategies. However, numerical models for simulating long-term effects of these processes are lacking. This paper investigates how an invasive alien plant species affects native riparian vegetation and hydro-morphodynamics. A morphodynamic model has been coupled to a dynamic vegetation model that predicts establishment, growth and mortality of riparian trees. We introduced an invasive alien species with life-history traits based on Japanese Knotweed (Fallopia japonica), and investigated effects of low- and high propagule pressure on invasion speed, native vegetation and hydro-morphodynamic processes. Results show that high propagule pressure leads to a decline in native species cover due to competition and the creation of unfavorable native colonization sites. With low propagule pressure the invader facilitates native seedling survival by creating favorable hydro-morphodynamic conditions at colonization sites. With high invader abundance, water levels are raised and sediment transport is reduced during the growing season. In winter, when the above-ground invader biomass is gone, results are reversed and the floodplain is more prone to erosion. Invasion effects thus depend on seasonal above- and below ground dynamic vegetation properties and persistence of the invader, on the characteristics of native species it replaces, and the combined interactions with hydro-morphodynamics.

TI  - Controlling Purple Jewelweed (Impatiens glandulifera): Assessment of Feasibility and Costs
AU  - Leblanc, Michael

T2  - Invasive Plant Science and Management
AB  - We experimentally tested the feasibility of a control campaign of purple jewelweed (Impatiens glandulifera), an exotic invasive species in Europe and North America. We evaluated the amount of time and money required to control the plant along riverbanks, with particular attention paid to the recovery of riparian vegetation following hand pulling and bagging. Work time was directly and significantly related to stem density and fresh biomass of the invader, but the relationship was stronger for density. Density and biomass were strongly reduced by the first hand-pulling operation from a mean of 45 to 2 stems m(-2) and from a mean of 0.95 kg m(-2) to nearly zero, a good performance but not enough to negate the need for a second hand pulling later in the summer. A single hand pulling significantly reduced the cover of purple jewelweed from to 30% to 7%. Riparian vegetation disturbed by the first hand pulling largely recovered during the following 30 d. Expressed over an area of 1 ha, the total amount of time required to control purple jewelweed is 1,400 work hours over 2 yr, or a minimum investment of Can$21,000 (US$17,000). Although controlling a well-established purple jewelweed population is expensive, to properly evaluate the benefits, we must also consider the costs of soil erosion caused by this species.

AB  - Consideration is given to the examples of suppression of restorative succession by invasive plant species (Solidago canadensis L., Helianthus subcanescens (A. Gray) E. Watson, Impatiens glandulifera Royle) in anthropogenic landscapes of southeastern Belarus. Characteristics of communities blocking the succession process have been revealed: low species richness, dominance of alien species in coverage, high level of synanthropization, and the absence of natural regeneration of trees and shrubs. It is suggested that a delay in succession is caused by the suppressing influence of transformer species on seed germination in apophytic trees.

T2  - Applied Vegetation Science
AB  - QuestionWhich environmental factors influence the occurrence of invasive alien plants (IAPs) in riparian habitats, and how much can IAPs account for change in native vegetation compared with other environmental variables? LocationRivers distributed throughout mainland Britain. MethodsWe quantified change in river bank vegetation using survey data collected approximately 20yr apart and assessed the contribution of major IAPs (Impatiens glandulifera, Heracleum mantegazzianum and Fallopia japonica) to these changes. We also determined the importance of abiotic factors such as flow regime and land use in driving these changes. ResultsComparing data from pre- and post-1990 surveys revealed that IAPs occurred mainly on lowland rivers (<200m a.s.l.), regardless of time period, and their probability of occurrence increased over time and with rising frequency of high flows. Native plant species diversity declined over time with increasing IAP cover, along lowland rivers and along all rivers that experienced extended low flows during the growing season. These conditions particularly favoured native dominant species, whereas native subordinate species responded both positively and negatively to increased flood frequency depending on survey period. Over time, Salix spp. and larger native hydrophilic species, such as Sparganium erectum, increased along lowland rivers, replacing smaller-statured ruderal species and driving a shift towards increased shade tolerance of subcanopy and groundcover species. Smaller compositional changes occurred in the uplands and these changes lacked a clear environmental signature. ConclusionsNational-scale changes in native riparian vegetation are likely driven primarily by environmental changes and land-use effects, rather than invasion by IAPs. However, IAPs, and indeed native species that benefit from abiotic changes, in turn, likely exert secondary effects on native riparian vegetation. The trend towards reduced diversity, increased shade tolerance and increased dominance of some native species and IAPs is likely linked to a set of interacting factors, including drier summers, wetter winters, increased riparian tree cover, reduced livestock access to river banks and increased fine sediment input. Determining combined effects of land use, IAPs and climate-related changes in flow regime over decadal time scales (i.e. similar to 20yr) is important for predicting ecological responses of vulnerable habitats under future disturbance scenarios.

AB  - The main aim of presented study was the comparison of various extraction methods for the quantitative and qualitative analysis (LC-ESI-MS/MS) of phenolic acids present in extracts obtained from leaves, flowers, and roots of Impatiens glandulifera. The accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) at three temperature ranges (80 degrees C, 100 degrees C, and 120 degrees C), ultrasound assisted extraction (USAE) at 60 degrees C, and traditional extraction in Soxhlet apparatus were used. Taking into account the extraction yield, and the diversity of the individual compounds, ultrasound assisted extraction proved to be the most efficient method, and it was used to determine the content of phenolic acids in leaves of four other Impatiens species, including I. balsamina, I. noli-tangere, I. parviflora, and I. walleriana. Eleven phenolic acids were identified in all examined species. These were protocatechuic, gentisic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, trans-caffeic, syringic, trans-p-coumaric, trans-and cis-ferulic, salicylic, and 3-hydroxycinnamic acids. In the extract from the leaves of I. balsamina and I. walleriana, gallic and cis-p-coumaric acids were found additionally. The most abundant compounds in all examined extracts were protocatechuic and 3-hydroxycinnamic acids. The latest acid was found in the highest yield in I. noli-tangere (266.12 mu g/g DW). In the leaves of I. glandulifera a great amount of 4- hydroxybenzoic (41.44 mu g/g DW), vanillic (61.50 mu g/g DW), and trans-pcoumaric (58.42 mu g/g DW) acids was also observed. Our results indicate that protocatechuic, 4hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, trans-p-coumaric, trans-ferulic, and 3-hydroxycinnamic acids were most characteristic of Impatiens species. Additionally, various phenolic-rich extracts from leaves, flowers, and roots of Impatiens glandulifera were tested for antioxidant activity. The highest antiradical activity was detected for roots using Soxhlet extraction (EC50 = 0.055 mg [DE/ml]). The study demonstrated that members of the genus Impatiens, and in particular Impatiens glandulifera, and Impatiens noli-tangere, contain significant amounts of phenolic acids. In addition, extracts from various parts of I. glandulifera could be interesting as novel sources of natural antioxidants. (C) 2017 Phytochemical Society of Europe. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Invasions by alien plants significantly affect native biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We conducted a 5-year field experiment to investigate potential effects of the annual invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera on both the native above-ground vegetation and the soil seed bank in a deciduous forest in Switzerland. Eight years after the establishment of I. glandulifera, we set up plots in patches invaded by the alien plant, in plots from which the invasive plant had been manually removed and in plots which were not yet colonized by the invasive plant. We examined plant species richness, diversity and plant species composition in the above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank in all plots one year and five years after the initiation of the experiment. The 36 plots (3 plot types x 6 replicates x 2 sites) were equally distributed over two forest sites. Neither the native above-ground vegetation nor the soil seed bank was influenced by the presence of I. glandulifera one year after the start of the field experiment. After five years, however, plant species richness of both the above-ground vegetation and the soil seed bank was reduced by 25% and 30%, respectively, in plots invaded by the alien plant compared to plots from which I. glandulifera had been removed or uninvaded plots. Furthermore, plots invaded by the alien plant had a lower total seedling density (reduction by 60%) and an altered plant species composition in the soil seed bank compared to control plots. Our field experiment indicates that negative effects of the annual invasive plant on the native above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank of deciduous forests become visible with a delay of several years.

T2  - Diversity and Distributions
AB  - Aim Riparian habitats are amongst the most invaded ecosystems world-wide. The great abundance of invasive species in river corridors is attributed to the efficient transport of alien species' propagules and reduced competition from native plants due to regular flooding. Once an invasive species has become established, river corridors can serve as stepping stones for spread into other habitats. We have chosen the Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera Royle, highly invasive annual in riparian areas, as a model for spread of invasive species from linear river corridors. Location Central Europe. Methods We mapped its distribution and recorded its abundance in over 1200 patches along four rivers in central Europe, differing in the time of balsam's introduction (1900-1995). The patches were characterized in terms of the distance from the riverbank, height above the river surface, degree of soil disturbance and flooding regime. Results The patches at sites subject to flooding had twice as many individuals as those that were not subject to flooding, regardless of their distance from the riverbank and height above the river surface. There was a strong effect of the river identity, with river invaded 20 years ago being less infested than those invaded earlier. The distance from the riverbank at which the populations occurred differed and did not depend on river identity/residence time. The patches in tributaries were on average two times further from the bank of the main river than those located elsewhere. Main conclusions Flooding is an important factor affecting the abundance of I. glandulifera, and accounts for its spread and dominance along river corridors probably due to spreading the seeds, increasing nutrient availability and disturbing native vegetation. It is likely that the number of I. glandulifera populations will increase in the future, especially along small water courses.

T2  - Acta Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae
AB  - The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) attributes the invasive behavior of some alien species to decreased pressure from natural enemies, as they have been left behind in the hosts' native range. The majority of research supports this idea, but some studies confirm it only partially or even contradict it. Here, we present the results of ERH tests of three Impatiens species studied in southern Poland in 2010-2011. Two of them are alien and invasive in Europe (Impatiens glandulifera, I. parviflora) and one is native (I. noli-tangere). We compared the three species in terms of the percentage of all leaves showing symptoms of disease and/or damage, and also the number of pests recorded on the monitored plants. In 1071 individual plant controls, we assessed 17 180 leaves, 7552 of which showed symptoms of disease/damage, and we recorded 5721 invertebrates, 5220 of them were pests. Rusts and spots were the predominant symptoms and Aphidoidea were the dominant group of pests. Comparisons of the two alien and one native Impatiens did not confirm the ERH in 90% of the performed tests. Most of the differences between the species were not significant, and most of the significant ones contradicted the ERH. The only results confirming the ERH were found in comparisons between I. parviflora and I. noli-tangere. The tests between two alien species showed that I. parviflora was under higher pest pressure, while I. glandulifera had more disease and damage symptoms, thus, plant-enemy relations differed between the two balsams. In summary, the presented results add evidence that the success of some alien species may depend on factors related to biotic and/or abiotic conditions in ways that are not explained by the enemy release hypothesis.

AU  - Balazi, Peter

T2  - Botany Letters
AB  - Effect of environmental variables on macrophyte assemblages were studied in 97 small and medium-sized rivers in two bioregions (Pannonian and Carpathian) in Slovakia during three years (2013-2016). In total, 153 species were determined (100 vascular plants, 36 bryophytes and 17 macro-algal growths); 106 taxa and 113 taxa in the Pannonian and the Carpathian bioregion, respectively. The floristic composition of the studied bioregions varies and is influenced by several sets of environmental variables. Macrophyte vegetation in the Pannonian bioregion is influenced by altitude, width of the river bed, flow velocity and water reaction (explaining 16.3% of variability), whilst mesolithal, depth of water, shading by trees, concentration of total phosphorus in water and altitude (21.9%) drive species composition in the Carpathians. Similarly to overall species composition, the distribution pattern of alien and endangered species differs between bioregions. In the Carpathian bioregion, endangered species are concentrated in two groups (vascular vs. non-vascular plants) according to the width of the river bed and flow velocity. In contrast, all evaluated species groups (endangered, alien and other species) have scattered distribution in the Pannonian bioregion. Two endangered species, Butomus umbellatus and Berula erecta, exceed the frequency of 20% only in the Pannonian bioregion. On the other hand, the frequency of 10% is exceeded by two alien species, Elodea canadensis in the Pannonian bioregion and Impatiens glandulifera in the Carpathian bioregion. In conclusion, monitoring of aquatic macrophytes, including endangered and alien species, provides valuable information usable in ecological assessment.

AB  - The hypothesis seeks to answer the question to what degree are habitats affected by invasive knotweed (Reynoutria spp.), impatiens (Impatiens glandulifera) and other neophytes after chemical eradication has been used in the area. The method is based on the habitats mapping and the phytosociological releves along a migration sphere. It also pays regard to the level of invasion of neophytes. These three factors were used to characterize habitats. The habitats were divided according to the features of their ecotype and invasion of neophytes. The eradication was used to prevent the spread of Reynoutria spp. species and to preserve rare native plant communities at the National Natural Heritage Area Skalicka Moravka. Reynoutria spp. had created huge shrub coverage before the herbicide was applied. Survey results showed spot occurrence of Reynoutria spp. at 62 % of the area but when compared with the mapping of previous years, there was decreasing coverage. Unfortunately Impatiens glandulifera filled a vacant ecological niche after the Reynoutria spp. was eradicated so there was no regeneration of native habitats. The increase of affected habitats strongly influenced or created by man to the detriment of the native habitats, lowered the attractiveness of the area in terms of recreational use, creating new obstacles and reducing the interest of the protected territory for ordinary visitors.

TI  - Direct interactions between invasive plants and native pollinators: evidence, impacts and approaches
AU  - Stout, Jane C.
AU  - Tiedeken, Erin Jo
T2  - Functional Ecology
AB  - 1. Invasive non-native plants form interactions with native species and have the potential to cause direct and indirect impacts on those species, as well as the functioning of invaded ecosystems. 2. Many entomophilous invasive plants form interactions with resident pollinators; sometimes, these interactions are necessary for the reproductive success of the invader. However, the direct role native pollinators play in plant invasion is not well understood and varies according to invasive plant traits, including breeding system and pollination syndrome. 3. The majority of studies addressing impacts on plant-pollinator mutualisms have focussed on the indirect impacts of plant invasion for native plant pollination. Fewer studies have focussed on the direct effects of invasive plants on native flower visitors. 4. Impacts of invasive plants on native pollinators can occur at a range of scales: from the individual flower visitors (in terms of nutrition, health and fitness), to populations (size, density and growth rates), communities (richness, diversity and composition) and community-level interactions (insect-flower interaction networks). Most research to date has focussed on community-level impacts, with almost nothing known about the effects of invaders on native flower visitor individuals or populations. 5. Invasive plant traits, including reward quantity and quality, spatial and temporal availability and accessibility, modulate effects on native flower visitors, and thus, different plant species have different impacts. Similarly, flower visitors do not all respond in the same way to invasive plants. Thus, generalizations are difficult to make, but understanding impacts at the individual and population level for different visitor taxa is key to explaining community-level impacts. 6. There have been varied approaches to determining impacts, with most studies attempting to compare invaded vs. non-invaded habitats. The pros and cons of different approaches are discussed. 7. Since it is impractical to study every invasive plant in every ecological context in which it occurs, we recommend a better understanding of relevant individual-level traits to predict direct interactions between invasive plants and native pollinators.

AB  - AimUsing three North American species invading Europe (Aster novi-belgii, Lupinus polyphyllus and Solidago canadensis) and three European species invading North America (Agrostis capillaris, Bromus tectorum and Cirsium arvense), we tested (1) whether the dominant species impact differs between its native and invaded ranges and (2) whether the impacts differ according to the direction of invasion (from Europe to North America and vice versa). LocationNorth America (USA) and central Europe (Czech Republic). MethodsThe dominance of the selected species was expressed as its relative cover, and its relationship to species richness was tested using marginal and mixed-effect regression models. ResultsAll the three North American species invading Europe suppressed species richness in the native range, while only two (A. novi-belgii and L. polyphyllus) impacted native species richness in the invaded range. On the contrary, of the three European species invading North America, only A. capillaris was found to suppress species richness in its native range, while all three suppressed it in the invaded range. Overall, the richness of native species responded significantly more negatively to the dominant species cover in its invaded rather than native range, regardless of the identity of the dominant species. Main conclusionsInvasive species suppress diversity more in the invaded range, and European invaders have more profound impacts in North America than North American invaders in Europe. We suggest that long-term coexistence and species filtering are responsible for the lower impacts in the native range, while large-scale evolutionary patterns are likely to be associated with the more profound impacts of selected European species as invaders in North America than vice versa.

TI  - Evolution of plant defences along an invasion chronosequence: defence is lost due to enemy release - but not forever

T2  - Journal of Ecology
AB  - 1. The success of invasive plants has often been attributed to their rapid evolution at the introduced range. In particular, release from native enemies has been suggested to select for an evolutionary shift in resource allocation patterns from herbivore defence to increased size. Such evolutionary processes can take place not only between the native and invasive ranges but also within the invasive range over time, but this premise has been very seldom studied. 2. In this study, we examined the potential for post-invasion evolution in two traits hypothesized to facilitate plant invasion success, that is herbivore resistance and allelopathic ability. We studied these traits in the invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera by comparing plants from its native populations and from populations across its invasion chronosequence. 3. Results of common-garden experiment and chemical analyses revealed that plants from native populations or older populations within the invasive range show greater resistance to the generalist herbivore, Deilephila elpenor, coupled with greater production of the secondary defence compound 2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone glycoside. In contrast, no differences were found between populations in their allelopathic effect on the germination of the co-occurring neighbour, Urtica doica. Finally, results from a field survey suggested that older populations within the invasive range incur greater attack rates from local herbivores compared to more recently established populations. 4. Synthesis. Our findings support the idea that the selection pressure of enemy release at the introduced range might attenuate over time, leading to the evolutionary recovery of enemy resistance. This study emphasizes the importance of incorporating the effect of time since introduction when examining evolutionary or ecological processes of plant invasions.

AB  - Monitoring and species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used to support conservation planning but are rarely projected at a very high resolution for conservation management. In this study, we compared the population distribution and size of five invasive plant species along an 18 km alluvial system in Switzerland, over a period of 11 years. Exhaustive inventories of past (2001) to current (2012) populations showed a massive increase in invaded areas over the eleven years. Impatiens glandulifera and Reynoutria japonica were the species with the largest increases in population number and size. The ecological preferences of each species were then modelled at 1 m resolution, using environmental variables expressing topography, disturbances, dispersal, soil texture and light availability. SDMs successfully depicted the niches at very high resolution. Some of the important predictors (e.g., canopy density, distance to river) would have been unhelpful at a coarser resolution. From these very-high-resolution models, we predicted the potential distribution and abundance of species and derived two indices indicating the amount of habitat still available for future species colonisation, crucial information for management. Large, empty areas were predicted to be suitable for each species, suggesting that the observed increase in population size may continue in the future. The two proposed range-filling indices and abundance models may be used efficiently in future studies at very fine resolution to prioritise eradication efforts in previously invaded areas and controls in areas at high risk of invasion. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the efficiency of SDMs to predict invasions at such a fine resolution.

T2  - Plant Ecology
AB  - The study aimed to examine the effect of the invasion of the two congeneric species Impatiens glandulifera and Impatiens parviflora on species richness and composition across a wide range of communities in North-western Germany. We applied a space-for-time substitution approach, comparing invaded plots with adjacent, environmentally similar uninvaded plots, based on the assumption that the latter represent the situation prior to an invasion. Even though the dominance of the invasive species resulted in a lower Shannon diversity in the invaded plots, species richness was not (I. parviflora) or only weakly (I. glandulifera) reduced. Also the community composition of the invaded sites was only marginally different. Invaded and uninvaded plots in general had similar habitat conditions, but both Impatiens species occurred in slightly shadier sites compared to the uninvaded areas, and the plots invaded by I. parviflora tended to have higher nutrient concentrations. These results suggest that dense populations of invading species may often be found at particular microsites. The relatively low impact of Impatiens on the vegetation is most likely caused by the annual life strategy of the species: while I. glandulifera shows large fluctuations in numbers between years and has a later phenological development than most other species in its habitat, I. parviflora establishes preferably in dark and acidic, often disturbed woodlands where it competes with few other species.

AU  - Nobis, Agnieszka

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - Plant invasions and land cover changes are two important threats to biodiversity. River valleys, which are considered as hotspots of biodiversity, have been subjected to the both threats for centuries. Here we examined the impact of river bed proximity and land cover heterogeneity on the species richness of native, red-listed and invasive plants as well as the spatial associations between the three plant groups for alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity. Surveys were conducted in 140 plots (1 km(2) each) in the San River Valley (SE Poland). Our study showed that proximity to the river bed and land cover diversity was positively associated with both native and invasive plant species richness. The species richness of all three plant groups in the studied plots (alpha-diversity) was positively correlated across space. However, invasive plant species richness was negatively linked to beta- and gamma-diversity of native and red-listed species. In contrast, native plant species richness correlated neither with beta- nor with gamma-diversity of invasive species, thus, the hampering effect of high species richness on invasions was not confirmed. We conclude that studies of invasive plants should include multiple diversity levels as the effects may be hidden when evaluations are only made at the local spatial scale (alpha-diversity). Our study suggests that maintenance and restoration of forests close to the river may hamper alien plant invasions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The GC and GC-MS methods resulted in identification of 226 volatile compounds comprising from 61.7%-88.2% of the total amount. The essential oils differed significantly in their composition. Fifteen compounds were shared among the essential oils of all investigated Impatiens species. The majority of these constituents was linalool (0.7%-15.1%), hexanal (0.2%-5.3%) and benzaldehyde (0.1%-10.2%). Moreover, the antioxidant activity of the essential oils was investigated using different methods. The chemical composition of the essential oils and its antioxidant evaluation are reported for the first time from the investigated taxon.

T2  - Journal for Nature Conservation
AB  - Protected areas play a key role in biodiversity conservation, yet they face numerous pressures including the spread of invasive alien species (IAS). We designed a structured online survey to investigate the distribution and management of 53 invasive alien plant species in large protected areas, i.e. national parks and biosphere reserves, in eight Central European countries. We contacted 93 protected areas management authorities, of which 46 replied. In 44 protected areas (96% of those responding), at least one IAS was present, and in 37 protected areas (80%) IAS were managed. On average, 11.2 +/- 6.9 IAS were present per protected area and 4.3 +/- 3.4 (41%) of these were managed. A one-way ANOVA showed no significant difference in the number of IAS present or managed between the different protected area designations (national parks, biosphere reserves). Similarly, neither the size nor the founding year of the protected area influenced the number of IAS present or managed. Thirty-one species (58%) were managed in at least one protected area. The most widely managed species were Fallopia japonica (23 protected areas), Heracleum mantegazzianum (20), and Impatiens glandulifera (16). The amount of financial resources devoted to IAS management was rather low, corresponding to 3.1 +/- 4.4% of the total budget for natural resources management of the protected areas. We conclude that a lack of dedicated funding for IAS management in most protected areas and a lack of coordinated response between protected areas currently limit the effectiveness of the IAS management. In particular, an increased exchange of expertise between protected areas, and the development of minimum standards for IAS surveillance and management are pivotal. In addition, documenting best practice examples and synthesizing lessons learned in IAS management are urgently needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Finnish varietal honeys are valued specialty foods with unique characteristics, owing to their botanical origin. H-1 NMR metabolomics was applied to examine the compositional differences and origin-related markers of naturally complex boreal honeys (buckwheat, clover, dandelion, heather, Himalayan balsam, honeydew, linden, lingonberry, multifloral). Special focus was on the metabolites in aqueous samples. Chloroform extracts of selected samples were also analyzed for additional metabolic evidence. Qualitative profiling revealed 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric, 2-hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic, 3-methy1-2-oxopentanoic and 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acids as specific markers for dandelion (Taraxacum spp.) honeys. Full discrimination of buckwheat, dandelion, heather, and honeydew honeys was achieved with principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Melezitose, glucose, and fructose explained 83% of the variation in the PCA. The OPLS-DA loadings highlighted the discriminatory effect of the origin-specific non-saccharide metabolites. This study is a platform for a national honey library and analysis service. The results will facilitate and rationalize the characterization and quality control of the boreal varietal honeys.

AB  - The aim of present study was to determine and to compare the chemical composition of six Impatiens species. For this purpose, UHPLC-DAD-MS3 analyses and spectrophotometric assays were used. The results revealed the presence of nineteen constituents comprising phenolic acids and flavonoids. The total phenolic content in the samples ranged from 8.8 to 21.6 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g dry weight (DW), total flavonoids ranged from 3.2 to 6.3 mg QE/g DW, and total phenolic acids ranged from 1.4 to 4.7 mg CAE/g DW. Moreover, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the prepared extracts were investigated using different methods. The study demonstrated that members of the genus Impatiens, and in particular Impatiens balfourii, Impatiens glandulifera, and Impatiens parviflora, contain significant amounts of phenolic acids and flavonoids. Therefore, extracts from various Impatiens species could be interesting as novel sources of antioxidants for the production of health-promoting supplements. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The annual dynamics of yeast communities were studied in the soddy-podzolic soil under the thickets of Aster x salignus Willd., one of the widespread invasive plant species in central Russia. Yeast groups in the soils under continuous aster thickets were found to differ greatly from the yeast communities in the soils under the adjacent indigenous meadow vegetation. In both biotopes the same species (Candida vartiovaarae, Candida sake, and Cryptococcus terreus) are dominants. However, in the soils under indigenous grasses, eurybiontic yeasts Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, which almost never occur in the soil under aster, are widespread. In the soil under aster, the shares of other typical epiphytic and pedobiontic yeast fungi (ascomycetic species Wickerhamomyces aniomalus, Barnettozyma californica and basidiomycetic species Cystofilobasidium macerans, Guehomyces pullulans) significantly increase. Thus, the invasion of Aster x salignus has a clear effect on soil yeast complexes reducing their taxonomic and ecological diversity.

AB  - Strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum) is a shade-tolerant shrub or small tree invader in tropical and subtropical regions and is considered among the world's top 100 worst invasive species. Studies from affected regions report deleterious effects of strawberry guava invasion on native vegetation. Here we examine the life history demographics and environmental determinants of strawberry guava invasions to inform effective weed management in affected rainforest regions. We surveyed the vegetation of 8 mature rainforest and 33 successional sites at various stages of regeneration in the Australian Wet Tropics and found that strawberry guava invasion was largely restricted to successional forests. Strawberry guava exhibited high stem and seedling densities, represented approximately 8% of all individual stems recorded and 20% of all seedlings recorded. The species also had the highest basal area among all the non-native woody species measured. We compared environmental and community level effects between strawberry guava-invaded and non-invaded sites, and modelled how the species basal area and recruitment patterns respond to these effects. Invaded sites differed from non-invaded sites in several environmental features such as aspect, distance from intact forest blocks, as well as supported higher grass and herb stem densities. Our analysis showed that invasion is currently ongoing in secondary forests, and also that strawberry guava is able to establish and persist under closed canopies. If left unchecked, strawberry guava invasion will have deleterious consequences for native regenerating forest in the Australian Wet Tropics.

AB  - Impatiens glandulifera is one of the most widespread invasive plant species in the UK. Although aspects of its biology are known, there is little information about its association with microbial communities, both above ground and below ground. Furthermore, it is unknown whether this species exhibits any form of plant-soil feedback (PSF), commonly seen in other invasive weeds. We conducted a PSF experiment, in which plants of I. glandulifera were grown in soil that supported the species and compared with plants grown in a control soil from the same locality. Soil nutrients were measured, and the soil and foliar microbial communities were assessed. Impatiens glandulifera grew larger and faster in conditioned soil compared with the control. Higher levels of phosphate were also found in conditioned soils. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) colonisation was lower in conditioned soils, suggesting that I.glandulifera may rapidly alter AMF communities in invaded areas. PSFs had a significant effect on the foliar endophyte community, with clear separation of species between conditioned and control soils. These results show that I.glandulifera displayed a positive PSF and the PSF mechanism extended beyond the soil microbial community to affect foliar endophytes. The observed increase in endophytes in plants grown in conditioned soil could enhance resistance to herbivory, thus further accentuating the invasive properties of this species.

AB  - Understanding how invasive plants modify symbiotic interactions between ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi and native host trees is a central goal in invasion biology. We examined the effect of the annual invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera on the EM association and performance of Fagus sylvatica saplings in a controlled field experiment at three sites in a deciduous forest in Switzerland. A total of 1188 one-year-old F. sylvatica saplings were planted either in plots invaded by I. glandulifera, in plots from which the invasive plant had been manually removed or in plots which were not yet colonized by the invasive plant. The 54 (3 x 18) plots were equally distributed over three sites. Saplings, including their full root systems were harvested after 3, 6 and 15 months. Exudates of the invasive plant were extracted from resin bags buried in the soil during the seedling, flowering and senescent stage of I. glandulifera. EM colonization on F. sylvatica saplings growing in invaded plot was 33% lower after 3 months and 66% lower after 15 months than saplings growing in plots from which I. glandulifera had been removed and in uninvaded plots. Survival and biomass of saplings were reduced by 16% and 30% after 15 months in plots invaded by I. glandulifera. Analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region of fungal rDNA (ITS) showed that the number of EM species was highly correlated with the number of EM morphotypes, indicating that the latter can be considered as a surrogate for EM species richness on roots of F. sylvatica saplings. EM morphotype richness on saplings was 32% lower after 15 months in invaded plots as compared to control plots. Chemical analysis revealed a high amount of naphthoquinones in plots with I. glandulifera suggesting that this putative allelochemical can be responsible for the reduction in both EM colonization and morphotype richness.

AB  - Impatiens glandulifera has been imported from Himalaya in Europe and is considered as an invasive alien plant whose spreading arouses increasing interest among scientific literature. Via anti-cancer bioguiding, two new glucosylated steroids, named glanduliferins A and B, were isolated from the dried stem of I. glandulifera plants, together with the well-known a-spinasterol and 2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, which are also isolated from roots and leaves. They were characterized as 17-(2-hydroxy-2-pentamethylcyclopropyl-ethyl)-10,13-dimethyl-2,3,4,5,6,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17-tetradecahydro-1H-cyclopents[a]phenathren-3-0-(4-0-acetyl)-alpha- o-glucopyranoside and 17-(4-ethyl-1,5-dimethyl-hex-2-eny1)-10,13-dimethyl-2,3,4,5,6,9,10,11,12,13,14,15, 16,17-tetradecahydro-1H-cyclopents[alphenathren-3-0-(6-O-acetyl)-13-D-glucopyranoside using various NMR and HRESIMS techniques and chemical methods. In vitro determination of the growth inhibitory activity of the four isolated compounds using the KM' colorimetric assay revealed mean IC50 growth inhibitory value of similar to 30 mu M for glanduliferin A while glanduliferin B and a-spinasterol were poorly active till 100 mu M. 2-methoxy1,4-naphthoquinone revealed to be active in the single micromolar digit range as previously described. Quantitative videomicroscopy analyses of the effects of glanduliferins A and B suggested cytostatic rather than cytotoxic activity in U373 glioblastoma (GBM) cells. (C)2016 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - Phytochemical Analysis
AB  - IntroductionImpatiens glandulifera Royle (Balsaminaceae) is an annual herb from the Himalaya region, currently widespread along European river systems and one of the most important neophyte invading plants in Germany. Exploring the effects of allelopathic plant chemicals is important for the understanding of its ecological impacts in the process of suppression of indigenous plant species. ObjectiveTo investigate the chemical composition of Impatiens glandulifera flowers (IGFs) using high performance countercurrent chromatography (HPCCC). MethodsThe flowers of Impatiens glandulifera were manually separated and extracted with ethanol. LC-ESI-MS/MS was used to characterise the crude extract of IGF. The various flavonoids detected were isolated by HPCCC using of methyl tert-butyl ether-acetonitrile-water (2:2:3, v/v/v). The combination of the data provided by preparative ESI-MS/MS metabolite profiling, LC-ESI-MS/MS, UV-vis and 1D/2D-NMR spectroscopic analysis was used to elucidate the structures of the isolated compounds. ResultsHPCCC runs led to the direct isolation of pure dihydromyricetin (ampelopsin), eriodictyol-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside (astragalin) and kaempferol-3-O-6"-malonyl-glucoside, as well as the pre-purification of kaempferol-3-O-rhamno-rhamnosyldiglucoside, quercetin-3-O-galactoside (hyperoside), quercetin and kaempferol in a single step. ConclusionThis is the first report on the flavonoid composition of the species Impatiens glandulifera. The developed protocol was successfully used to isolate the main flavonoids from the crude extract of IGFs. This combined HPCCC and HPLC procedure could be applied to the fast fractionation and recovery of flavonoid derivatives of other plant extracts. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Impatiens glandulifera (Balsaminaceae) is one of the most important neophyte invading plant in Germany. Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate the chemical composition of its flowers using high performance countercurrent chromatography (HPCCC). HPCCC runs lead to the isolation of dihydromyricetin, eriodictyol-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside and kaempferol-3-O-6-malonyl-glucoside, as well as the pre-purification of kaempferol-3-O-rhamnosyldiglucoside, quercetin-3-O-galactoside, quercetin and kaempferol in a single step.

TI  - Cover thresholds for impacts of an exotic grass on the structure and assembly of a wet prairie community
AU  - Toth, Louis A.
T2  - Wetlands Ecology and Management
AB  - Potential impacts of an exotic grass, Hemarthria altissima, on restoration of wet prairie community structure (species richness and cover of indicator species) and assembly processes (temporal turnover rates of plant species) on the Kissimmee River floodplain in Central Florida, USA, were evaluated over a 12-year period before and after restoration of hydrologic regimes (2001), and implementation of herbicide treatments (2006-2007) to control its spread. Thresholds for impacts were derived from comparisons of sample sites with variable levels of H. altissima cover. Prior to herbicide treatments, cover of H. altissima exhibited a logistic increase over time, with peak colonization and expansion occurring during major flood events. Mean post-restoration cover of three native wet prairie indicator species (Polygonum punctatum, Panicum hemitomon, and Luziola fluitans) increased to 37.8 +/- A 3.4 % in plots in which H. altissima cover was < 12 %, and did not exceed 15 % in any plots with H. altissima cover > 30 %. Prior to and after herbicide treatments, these indicator species largely accounted for observed differences in wet prairie community structure (i.e., cover of wetland forbs and grasses) between heavily infested sites and plots with low or no cover of H. altissima. The cover threshold at which H. altissima began to have these community-level effects was 40-50 %, but lower species richness was found only where H. altissima cover was > 80 %. Increasing cover of H. altissima led to a significant decline in temporal turnover rates of plant species (P < 0.001, r(2) = 0.10), but also was largely due to plots with very high (> 75 %) cover of H. altissima. Mean temporal turnover rates of plant species increased significantly (P = 0.03) after herbicide treatments and subsequently were highest during an ensuing flood pulse. However, 2-3 years after herbicide treatments, regrowth of H. altissima reestablished high cover (mean = 59 +/- A 9.5 %) in over half of the treated plots. The ability of H. altissima to establish dominant cover in restored hydrologic conditions on the Kissimmee River floodplain, and documented regrowth following herbicide treatments, increase the potential for this exotic grass species to be a pervasive threat to successful reestablishment of wet prairie community structure and assembly processes.

AB  - Riparian zones are key landscape features, representing the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Although they have been influenced by human activities for centuries, their degradation has increased during the 20th century. Concomitant with (or as consequences of) these disturbances, the invasion of exotic species has increased throughout the world's riparian zones. In our study, we propose a easily reproducible methodological framework to map three riparian invasive taxa using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) imagery: Impatiens glandulifera Royle, Heracleum mantegazzianum Sommier and Levier, and Japanese knotweed (Fallopia sachalinensis (F. Schmidt Petrop.), Fallopia japonica (Houtt.) and hybrids). Based on visible and near-infrared UAS orthophoto, we derived simple spectral and texture image metrics computed at various scales of image segmentation (10, 30, 45, 60 using eCognition software). Supervised classification based on the random forests algorithm was used to identify the most relevant variable (or combination of variables) derived from UAS imagery for mapping riparian invasive plant species. The models were built using 20% of the dataset, the rest of the dataset being used as a test set (80%). Except for H. mantegazzianum, the best results in terms of global accuracy were achieved with the finest scale of analysis (segmentation scale parameter = 10). The best values of overall accuracies reached 72%, 68%, and 97% for I. glandulifera, Japanese knotweed, and H. mantegazzianum respectively. In terms of selected metrics, simple spectral metrics (layer mean/camera brightness) were the most used. Our results also confirm the added value of texture metrics (GLCM derivatives) for mapping riparian invasive species. The results obtained for I. glandulifera and Japanese knotweed do not reach sufficient accuracies for operational applications. However, the results achieved for H. mantegazzianum are encouraging. The high accuracies values combined to relatively light model-inputs needed (delineation of a few umbels) make our approach a serious contender as a cost-effective tool to improve the field management of H. mantegazzianum.

AB  - The occurrence of an invasive plant across a continent is generally not homogeneous; typically, some areas are highly invaded whereas others show moderate or low invasion levels. This situation might be a snapshot of an ongoing spread, but it could also remain stable under the pressure of factors that constrain the invasion. Among those factors, plant performance variation among invasion levels can explain an invasion slowdown. However, few studies have investigated the large-scale variation of invasive plant performance in the field. Ambrosia artemisiifolia L in Western Europe represents a good opportunity to address this issue, with areas of high, moderate and low invasion levels being documented across a ca. 1000 km transect. In this study, we compared in situ plant performance-related traits in 12 populations from areas of contrasting invasion levels. We also tested whether performance-related traits were influenced by the intra-and inter-specific competition, by the local climatic conditions or by latitude (a proxy for growing season length). Overall, we did not find differences in performance-related traits across invasion levels, and intra-and inter-specific competition had low effects on plant performance. This study highlights the fact that A. artemisiifolia individuals express similar performance across invasion levels, even beyond what can be considered the present invasion front. Further research has to expand this study northwards, and assess other factors that could constrain the invasion in order to highlight if the species invasion northward is constrained or if it has the potential to invade new areas.

TI  - INVASIVE PLANTS OF KALNIK FORESTS

T2  - Sumarski List
AB  - This paper presents an invasive plant species that occur in the forests of Kalnik. It also presents the state of the distribution and their impact on forests of Kalnik. A total of 14 invasive species in the forests of Kalnik and these are - Acer negundo L., Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle, Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., Amorpha fruticosa L., Asclepias syriaca L., Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronquist, Echinocystis lobata (Michx.) Torr. et Gray, Erigeron annuus (L.) Pers., Impatiens glandulifera Royle, Juncus tenuis Willd.), Phytolacca americana L., Reynoutria japonica Houtt., Robinia pseudoacacia L., Solidago gigantea Aiton. Alochtonous vegetation is not only inevitable, but it also appears to be a constant future challenge in the globalizing world which communicates on all levels with every means possible. Its influence should not by any means be marginalized. Its importance and influence is not completely negative and there are possible benefits and dangers which should be controlled by the preventive measures and physical regulation. The most important species in Kalnik forest vegetation is definitely acacia. It is especially important for private forest lands where acacia tree has become very popular because of its characteristics as a fast growing tree species without any special requirements with relation to growth and it gives fast results concerning timber and firewood. Private lots are usually very small and fragmented. There is a growing need for timber, therefore the trees are grown extensively, from stumps and roots. Other woody species still do not pose a serious threat in economical or biological sense. The impact of herbaceous plants differs in various areas. The most problematic issues for the forestersare thick layers of unwanted specieswhich grow in young forest stands or in forests in the phase of restorationwhere these unwanted speciesinvasively compete with autochthonous species. In biological sense, invasive species pose a constant threat not only to domestic vegetation and biodiversity, but also to human health. We should also mention apiculture, a very important and well developed activity on Kalnik. Above mentioned species are very important and interesting for apiculture as a type of rich bee pasturage. Apiculture in this area depends on acacia pasturage and it is one of very important reasons for growing acacia tree. Other tree species are also valuable for bee pasturage, especially late in autumn when there is no other bee pasturage available and they are mostly species which blossom in autumn and represent a valuable source of pollen (Japanese Knotweed, Prickly cucumber and European goldenrod). Generally speaking, the biggest responsibility for possible consequences of invasive plant species to the vegetation of Kalnik lies on foresters who have to recognize and monitor the appearance of invasive species, especially in state forest lands where they grow and directly influence their composition and state.

AB  - Invasive exotic plants often grow fast, reproduce rapidly and display considerable phenotypic plasticity in their invasive range, which may be essential characteristics for successful invasion. However, it remains unclear whether these characteristics are already present in native populations (pre-adaptation hypothesis) or evolve after introduction (genetic shift hypothesis). To test these hypotheses we compared means and phenotypic plasticity of vegetative and reproductive traits between populations of Impatiens glandulifera collected from either the invasive (Norway) or native range (India). Seeds were sown and the resulting plants were exposed to different experimental environments in a glasshouse. We also tested whether trait means and reaction norms harbored genetic variation, as this may promote fitness in the novel environment. We did not find evidence that invasive populations of I. glandulifera grew more vigorously or produced more seeds than native populations. Phenotypic plasticity did not differ between the native and invasive range, except for the number of nodes which was more plastic in the invasive range. Genetic variation in the slope of reaction norms was absent, suggesting that the lack of change in phenotypic plasticity between native and invasive populations resulted from low genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity initially harbored by this species. Post-introduction evolution of traits thus probably did not boost the invasiveness of I. glandulifera. Instead, the species seems to be pre-adapted for invasion. We suggest that differences in habitat between the native and invasive range, more specifically the higher nutrient availability observed in the new environment, are the main factor driving the invasion of this species. Indeed, plants in the more nutrient-rich invasive range had greater seed mass, likely conferring a competitive advantage, while seed mass also responded strongly to nutrients in the glasshouse. Interactions between habitat productivity and herbivore defense may explain the lack of more vigorous growth in the new range. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Horizon scanning for high-risk invasive non-native species (INNS) is crucial in preparing and implementing measures to prevent introductions, as well as to focus efforts in the control of species already present. We initiated a trans-national horizon-scanning exercise focused on four countries in western Europe: Great Britain, France, Belgium and The Netherlands, which share similar environmental and socio-economic characteristics. We followed a structured four-step approach combining existing knowledge about INNS, with a collaborative identification of priorities for research and management: (1) systematic review of potential INNS of concern, (2) discrimination of INNS into an Alert and Black List depending on their absence or presence in the study area respectively, (3) risk analysis of the Alert List, and (4) expert ranking of species in the Black List. Amongst species not yet present in the four countries (i.e. Alert List), assessors reliably pointed to the Emerald ash-borer (Agrilus planipennis) and Sosnowski's hogweed (Heracleum sosnowskyi) as those INNS with the highest risk of invasion and impact. The Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica), Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera), zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and killer shrimp (Dikerogammarus villosus) were consistently highlighted as some of the most problematic INNS already present in the study area (i.e. Black List). The advantages of our combined approach include that it is inclusive of all-taxa, prioritizes both established and emerging biological threats across trans-national scales, and considers not only the ecological impact, but also potential direct economic consequences as well as the manageability of invasive species.

TI  - Invasive success and the evolution of enhanced weaponry
AU  - Gruntman, Michal
AU  - Zieger, Sinja

T2  - Oikos
AB  - A key hypothesis that has been proposed to explain plants' invasive success suggests that some invasive species produce allelochemicals that are novel against naive neighbours at the introduced range and therefore provide an advantage there (novel weapons hypothesis - NWH). However, a seldom-studied hypothesis suggests that invasive populations could not only possess novel weapons, but might also evolve their enhanced production. Moreover, so far no study has examined both the novelty and evolution of allelopathic effects. Here, we examined these two hypotheses in a set of experiments with the highly invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera. In the first experiment, we examined the evolution of allelopathic ability by comparing the inhibitory effects of leaf extracts from native versus invasive I. glandulifera on the germination success of its dominant neighbour Urtica dioica. In the following experiments, we examined the NWH by comparing the germination success of U. dioica seeds collected at the native versus invasive range of I. glandulifera, in response to either leaf extracts or soil trained with invasive I. glandulifera. The results of the first experiment indicate that invasive I. glandulifera exert a stronger inhibitory effect on the germination of U. dioica compared to their native counterparts, providing support for the hypothesis that allelopathic ability can evolve at the invasive range. However, the results of the two following experiments reveal no difference in the response of U. dioica from the native versus invasive range of I. glandulifera, to the allelopathic effects of either the leaf extracts or the trained soil. These results therefore do not provide support for the NWH, and suggest that increased allelopathy in invasive I. glandulifera might have been selected for by other processes. The results of this study call for biogeographical experiments that will examine not only the novelty but also the evolution of allelopathic effects in invasive plants.

AB  - The management of invasive alien species (IAS) in protected areas has become increasingly important in recent years. In this study, we analyse IAS management in the bilateral National Park Thayatal-Podyji at the Austrian-Czech border. Based on two surveys from the years 2001 and 2010 and on annual management data from 2001-2010 we analyse changes in distribution and the efficiency of IAS management of three invasive alien plants (Fallopia x bohemica, Impatiens glandulifera, Robinia pseudoacacia). In 2010, the three study species had invaded 161 ha (2%) of the study area. Despite a decade of management, F. x bohemica has become widespread, whereas I. glandulifera distribution has decreased strongly. The most widespread species, R. pseudoacacia, has declined substantially in cover, but the area invaded has increased. From 2001 to 2010, annual management effort declined by about half. Management effort per hectare and decade was highest for F. x bohemica (2,657 hours), followed by R. pseudoacacia (1,473 hours) and I. glandulifera (270 hours). Management effort for achieving the same amount of reduction in population size and cover was highest for R. pseudoacacia, followed by F. x bohemica and I. glandulifera. We conclude that substantial effort and resources are necessary to successfully manage the study species and have to be provided over prolonged time periods, and thus continued management of these species is recommended. We highly recommend a systematic approach for monitoring the efficiency of IAS management projects in protected areas.

AB  - Biological invasions are a threat to the maintenance of ecological processes, including pollination. Plant-flower visitor networks are traditionally used as a surrogated for pollination at the community level, despite they do not represent the pollination process, which takes place at the stigma of plants where pollen grains are deposited. Here we investigated whether the invasion of the alien plant Impatiens glandulifera (Balsaminaceae) affects pollen transfer at the community level. We asked whether more alien pollen is deposited on the stigmas of plants on invaded sites, whether deposition is affected by stigma type (dry, semidry and wet) and whether the invasion of I. glandulifera changes the structure of the resulting pollen transfer networks. We sampled stigmas of plants on 10 sites invaded by I. glandulifera (hereafter, balsam) and 10 non-invaded control sites. All 20 networks had interactions with balsam pollen, although significantly more balsam pollen was found on plants with dry stigmas in invaded areas. Balsam pollen deposition was restricted to a small subset of plant species, which is surprising because pollinators are known to carry high loads of balsam pollen. Balsam invasion did not affect the loading of native pollen, nor did it affect pollen transfer network properties; networks were modular and poorly nested, both of which are likely to be related to the specificity of pollen transfer interactions. Our results indicate that pollination networks become more specialized when moving from the flower visitation to the level of pollen transfer networks. Therefore, caution is needed when inferring pollination from patterns of insect visitation or insect pollen loads as the relationship between these and pollen deposition is not straightforward.

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - Recent studies suggest that invasive plant species have colonised mountains to previously unobserved elevations, possibly due to ongoing climate change. Thus, they might pose new threats to high-elevation ecosystems, which are often of high conservation value. Current range predictions are primarily based on climate niche models, however many other factors might also contribute to the species' distribution. We studied the species-specific elevational limits of one native (Impatiens noli-tangere) and two invasive balsams (Impatiens glandulifera and Impatiens parviflora) on a mid-mountain range in Germany. We used a combination of trait measurements and a field experiment to assess the relative importance of temperature, trait adaptations, and biotic interactions on elevational limits. Results indicate that concurrent seedling emergence, low frost resistance and, for I. glandulifera, late flowering, are important contributors to elevational limits. Because of a lack of seed bank persistence, erratic spring and autumn frost events coinciding with the plants' annual life-cycles will likely influence the upper limits of the invasive species. The abundance of the species seems to be further limited by herbivory, mainly by molluscs. Given that a highly nuanced interaction between phenological development and erratic frost events are important for range limits, predictions based solely on mean climatic values, such.as temperature, are unlikely to accurately predict future invasion limits. Our results indicate that occasional occurrences of the species do not necessarily calHor eradication actions, that management efforts might be most effective at intermediate elevations, and that any measure encouraging terrestrial molluscs will help to maintain biotic resistance.

AB  - Many attempts have been made to restore semi-natural temperate grasslands that suffered substantial declines due to changes in land use in the past decades. An alternative to restoration of historical grassland is the establishment of analogous communities in new habitats like road verges. This study aims at assessing seed mixtures for road verges that cope with the need for bioengineering effectiveness while benefitting local biodiversity. We established a greenhouse experiment with microsite variation to study establishment, diversity and invasion resistance of four regional and two non-regional seed mixtures on road verge substrate, with and without stony microhabitats as a function of their seed source, functional group and trait composition. Vegetation cover was measured 6 and 12 weeks after sowing, as well as dry biomass of target and non-target species. Invasion resistance after establishment of native communities was tested by adding seeds of the alien Impatiens glandulifera Royle and later counting seedling emergence. Vegetation cover after 6 weeks was significantly affected by seed source and percentage legume seed, while stony microsites had negative effects on vegetation cover at both times. Percentage grass biomass reduced species richness, but had no influence on invasion resistance against non-target species. Functional dispersion (FDis) of rooting traits and aboveground biomass were not correlated with invasion resistance at the early stage of grassland development. Otherwise, the invasion of an alien species at a later stage was explained by seed mixture identity and thus, associated with lower diversity of rooting traits and lower species richness. Using regional seeds is recommended for road verge restoration, but only an appropriate balance of functional groups and traits within the seed mixtures can ensure quick establishment and high species richness.

AB  - The rust fungus Puccinia komarovii var. glanduliferae was first identified infecting Impatiens glandulifera in its native range (western Himalayas) between 2006 and 2010. Subsequently, it was imported into quarantine in the UK for evaluation as a classical biocontrol agent. To assess the safety of the rust, plant species relevant to Europe were tested for susceptibility. To confirm the life cycle, all infective spore stages were inoculated on I. glandulifera to follow disease progression. Teliospores were primed using bleaching and low temperatures to break dormancy. Temperature and dew period experiments using urediniospores were conducted to assess the parameters required for infection. Of the 74 plant species tested, only I. balsamina, an ornamental species, was fully susceptible to urediniospore inoculum. The life cycle of the rust - an autoecious, full-cycled species with five spore stages - was confirmed. Urediniospores were infective between 5 and 25 degrees C, with an optimum at 15 degrees C. A minimum of 8 h dew period was required to achieve consistent infection. Based on a pest risk assessment, the rust poses no threat to native biodiversity within EU Member States; making P. komarovii var. glanduliferae a suitable candidate as the first fungal classical biocontrol agent against an exotic weed in the region.

AB  - Identifying the floral composition of honey provides a method for investigating the plants that honey bees visit. We compared melissopalynology, where pollen grains retrieved from honey are identified morphologically, with a DNA metabarcoding approach using the rbcL DNA barcode marker and 454-pyrosequencing. We compared nine honeys supplied by beekeepers in the UK. DNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology were able to detect the most abundant floral components of honey. There was 92% correspondence for the plant taxa that had an abundance of over 20%. However, the level of similarity when all taxa were compared was lower, ranging from 22-45%, and there was little correspondence between the relative abundance of taxa found using the two techniques. DNA metabarcoding provided much greater repeatability, with a 64% taxa match compared to 28% with melissopalynology. DNA metabarcoding has the advantage over melissopalynology in that it does not require a high level of taxonomic expertise, a greater sample size can be screened and it provides greater resolution for some plant families. However, it does not provide a quantitative approach and pollen present in low levels are less likely to be detected. We investigated the plants that were frequently used by honey bees by examining the results obtained from both techniques. Plants with a broad taxonomic range were detected, covering 46 families and 25 orders, but a relatively small number of plants were consistently seen across multiple honey samples. Frequently found herbaceous species were Rubus fruticosus, Filipendula ulmaria, Taraxacum officinale, Trifolium spp., Brassica spp. and the non-native, invasive, Impatiens glandulifera. Tree pollen was frequently seen belonging to Castanea sativa, Crataegus monogyna and species of Malus, Salix and Quercus. We conclude that although honey bees are considered to be supergeneralists in their foraging choices, there are certain key species or plant groups that are particularly important in the honey bees environment. The reasons for this require further investigation in order to better understand honey bee nutritional requirements. DNA metabarcoding can be easily and widely used to investigate floral visitation in honey bees and can be adapted for use with other insects. It provides a starting point for investigating how we can better provide for the insects that we rely upon for pollination.

AB  - Background: Invasive species can be a major threat to native biodiversity and the number of invasive plant species is increasing across the globe. Population genetic studies of invasive species can provide key insights into their invasion history and ensuing evolution, but also for their control. Here we genetically characterise populations of Impatiens glandulifera, an invasive plant in Europe that can have a major impact on native plant communities. We compared populations from the species' native range in Kashmir, India, to those in its invaded range, along a latitudinal gradient in Europe. For comparison, the results from 39 other studies of genetic diversity in invasive species were collated. Results: Our results suggest that I. glandulifera was established in the wild in Europe at least twice, from an area outside of our Kashmir study area. Our results further revealed that the genetic diversity in invasive populations of I. glandulifera is unusually low compared to native populations, in particular when compared to other invasive species. Genetic drift rather than mutation seems to have played a role in differentiating populations in Europe. We find evidence of limitations to local gene flow after introduction to Europe, but somewhat less restrictions in the native range. I. glandulifera populations with significant inbreeding were only found in the species' native range and invasive species in general showed no increase in inbreeding upon leaving their native ranges. In Europe we detect cases of migration between distantly located populations. Human activities therefore seem to, at least partially, have facilitated not only introductions, but also further spread of I. glandulifera across Europe. Conclusions: Although multiple introductions will facilitate the retention of genetic diversity in invasive ranges, widespread invasive species can remain genetically relatively invariant also after multiple introductions. Phenotypic plasticity may therefore be an important component of the successful spread of Impatiens glandulifera across Europe.

AB  - Riparian zones support high biodiversity and are among the most vulnerable parts of the landscape. Their degradation facilitates the spread of invasive alien plant species. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between environmental characteristics of riparian zones and distribution and abundance of invasive alien plant taxa (IAT) along three rivers in Slovenia. In 100-m reaches of riparian zone we determined environmental characteristics and the presence and abundance of IAT. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to assess the relationship between IAT and environmental factors. The numbers and abundances of IAT in specific reaches were correlated with environmental factors using Spearman coefficient. These results revealed that the number and abundance of IAT in riparian zone were strongly positively correlated to the distance from river source, while they were negatively correlated with altitude, vegetation structure complexity, completeness of riparian zone and current velocity. Environmental factors that explained the distribution and abundance of IAT significantly were: the altitude, flow dynamics, distance from source, width of riparian zone, land-use, bank and channel structure, water depth and velocity. The research has pointed out the need for proper management of riparian zones to prevent invasion by IAT and also to strengthen other services provided by riparian zone as buffering anthropogenic impacts to water body, stabilising bank structure and increasing biodiversity.

AB  - In the past decades, many river restoration projects aiming to improve the ecological situation have been undertaken in central Europe. But the influence of invasive alien plants was insufficiently discussed in this context. The aim of the Life+ Traisen project is to restore the river Traisen in Lower Austria. The vegetation development was examined in the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 on 142 plots. Analysises show a significant loss of diversity and an increase in the abundance of invasive plants in the herb layer. The average number of species decreased with the rise in abundance of invasive plants. Already before the start of construction work on the new river course, various anthropogenic disturbances like large-scale forest clearance, earth movement and increased use of forest roads facilitates the spread of invasive plants, which in turn have an impact on the development of plant diversity in restored riparian areas. Since river restoration projects are accompanied by many man-made disturbances, invasive plant species should be taken into consideration from the very beginning of these projects. Reestablishment of natural dynamics in riparian areas is an important tool for the support of native plant diversity.

AB  - In a north European context, identifying invasive species is far from trivial because the vegetation has been influenced by human activities for thousands of years. New species have immigrated continuously since the end of the last glaciation, both spontaneously and through direct or indirect help by man. Still, newly immigrated species may be problematic in a nature conservation context and may harm biodiversity, and cause changes in ecosystem services. In this study, all 721 presently established vascular plant and bryophyte taxa known to have been introduced to, or to have immigrated to, Sweden since the year 1700 are assessed for their invasive potential. The assessment is based on six components considered relevant for their invasiveness: 1) ability to compete in natural vegetation, 2) ability to form dense populations, 3) realized dispersal ability, 4) gene flow to native relatives, 5) time since immigration and 6) distance to their native range. Although the relative importance of these components is context dependent, a compound general index of invasive concern is proposed and calculated for all taxa. The index of invasive concern is validated by comparing it to assessments by a Bayesian Belief Network in which the influences of the same six components are assigned by expert opinions. In addition, rough estimates of the present-day abundance of each taxon in Sweden are presented. The origin, biology and possible impact of the 150 taxa with the highest index values are discussed. Based on the index of invasive concern, Campylopus introflexus, Epilobium adenocaulon, E. ciliatum, Rosa rugosa, Lamiastrum galeobdolon subsp. argentatum, Orthodontium lineare, Solidago canadensis, Calystegia sepium subsp. spectabilis, Rubus armeniacus and Prunus serotina are identified as the ten most problematic alien vascular plant and bryophyte taxa in Sweden.

AB  - Background: Invasive species can interfere in the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Better understanding of the evolution of such species will be useful when planning their management and eradication. Aims: We aimed to compare patterns of genetic variability in Impatiens glandulifera in native and introduced regions. Methods: We used native samples from India and Pakistan, and non-native samples from Canada, Finland and the UK. Genetic analyses included genotyping using 10microsatellite markers and sequencing of the nuclear ITS region. Results: Mean allele numbers from native and introduced samples were even, 8.8 and 8.5, respectively, while expected heterozygosities were higher in native samples (mean 0.738) than in non-native samples (mean 0.477). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium testing indicated significant heterozygote deficiencies at 70% of the loci. Inbreeding coefficients were high in both native and introduced regions (range 0.201-0.726). STRUCTURE analyses showed that native samples from India and Pakistan possessed similar clustering patterns while non-native samples from the UK and Canada resembled each other. One of the four Finnish populations had a similar pattern with the UK and Canadian populations, while the rest showed similarly unique genetic compositions. ITS sequencing indicated in Pakistani samples two polymorphic sites not found in Indian samples but present in some samples from Canada, Finland and the UK. Conclusions: Distinct population genetic patterns indicate that human-mediated dispersal is important in I. glandulifera.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are one of the most important drivers of species loss. A series of recent (inter)national policies and guidelines however did not prevent new introductions and further spread of non-indigenous species. But instead of considering invasive plant species as a burden, the biomass production of IAS can be considered and used as an ecosystem service. To assess the possibilities for bioenergy production of four invasive alien plant species in Europe, Fallopia japonica, Heracleum mantegazzianum, Impatiens glandulifera and Solidago gigantea, we determined their biomass production, gross calorific value and biogas yield. The viability of the propagules after digestion was also tested to assess the dispersal risk related to the bioenergy chain. Fallopia japonica and S. gigantea achieved a high annual biomass yield of 8.6 ton DM per hectare. Impatiens glandulifera and H. mantegazzianum had a lower biomass production (5.8 and 6.0 ton DM ha(-1)). Without extra inputs or agronomic optimization of the crops, the anaerobic digestion of the studied invasive plant species achieved comparable energy outputs per hectare (28-88 GJ ha(-1)) as some of the current bioenergy systems. All propagules lost their viability after digestion. The risk of further invasion is thus minimized during the digestion process. However, caution during harvest and transport is required to prevent the spread of new propagules. The energetic valorization of the biomass of IAS can create an economic incentive for habitat restoration of invaded sites and offers the opportunity to reconcile the restoration of the invaded habitats with renewable energy goals.

AB  - The study aimed to assess the effects of the potential replacement of dominant native plants by co-occurring exotic invasives on organic matter degradation in a riparian area. The questions were: i) Is there a relationship between the litter breakdown rate and species origin? ii) Is the chemical composition more relevant than species origin? iii) Does species origin influence the associated saprophagous invertebrate community? Within the riparian zone of the Garonne River (France), we conducted a litterbag experiment using pairs of native and exotic species selected in the stages of the successional gradient. Native and exotic species did not differ in their primary chemical composition and breakdown rate. Litter breakdown rates were primarily driven by the C:N ratio with no influence of species origin. The abundance and diversity of saprophagous invertebrates of exotic and native species did not differ, but the composition did. Only one plant litter was completely degraded much earlier than expected (next litterfall) while remnant litter were still present at this time for the other species. The replacement of a dominant native by an exotic invasive plant species does not generally result in noticeable changes in the litter breakdown rate, which mainly depends on litter composition. Litter from quickly degrading exotic species may cause a resource discontinuity in invaded areas stabilized by river regulation.

AB  - Exotic invasive plants are known to decrease mollusc species richness and also abundances of many snail species. However, there is not much evidence on how invasive plants influence snail trophic behaviour. In this study, food preferences of alluvial land snails for invasive plants were studied. Two snail species (Succinea putris and Urticicola umbrosus) that commonly climb up invasive plants were chosen for food preference experiments. The five most widespread exotic plant species invading river flood-plains in Central Europe (Impatiens glandulifera, Helianthus tuberosus, Fallopia japonica, F. sachalinensis and F. x bohemica) and one native species (Urtica dioica) were chosen as food for the snails. Results of the study confirmed a broadly accepted opinion, that land snails prefer senescent to fresh plant material. The climbing efforts of the alluvial snails is therefore not for the purpose of foraging. The most important factors for snail food preferences were plant species identity and leaf condition. The exotic plants were consumed to different extent, probably due to differences in defence mechanisms. The highest consumption was recorded for H. tuberosus and U. dioica, which are protected on their surface by trichomes. Plants of the genus Fallopia, containing various secondary metabolites and high content of lignin, were mostly rejected. The native food source U. dioica did not change the preferences of the land snails when offered together with the invasive plants.

T2  - American Journal of Botany
AB  - Premise of the study: The ecological consequences of plant competition have frequently been tested, but the evolutionary outcomes of these interactions have gone largely unexplored. The study of species invasions can make an important contribution to this field of research by allowing us to watch ecological and evolutionary processes unfold as a novel species is integrated into a plant community. We explored the ecological and evolutionary impact of an invasive jewelweed, Impatiens glandulifera, on a closely related native congener, I. capensis and asked: (1) Does the presence of the invasive jewelweed alter the fitness of native jewelweed populations? (2) Does the invasive jewelweed affect the vegetative growth of the native congener? and (3) Does the invasive jewelweed alter phenotypic selection on the vegetative traits of the native congener? Methods: We used a greenhouse competition experiment, an invasive species removal field experiment, and a survey of natural populations. Key results: We show that when the invasive jewelweed is present, phenotypic selection favors native jewelweed individuals investing less in rapid upward growth and more in branching and fruiting potential through the production of nodes. Conclusions: This research demonstrates that invasive plants have the potential to greatly alter natural selection on native competitors. Studies investigating altered selection in invaded communities can reveal the potential evolutionary impact of invasive competitors, while deepening our understanding of the more general role of competition in driving plant evolution and permitting species coexistence.

AB  - Clearly defining the taxonomic identity of a potential biocontrol agent is an essential component of any biological control programme. As part of such a programme against Impatiens glandulifera, a highly invasive annual weed in both Europe and North America, the rust fungus Puccinia komarovii was collected on this host plant in its native Himalayan range. However, current literature indicates that P. komarovii is a pathogen of a number of Impatiens species globally and was described originally from I. parviflora, a species native to Asia and now naturalized in Europe. Morphological comparisons, based on urediniospore and teliospore measurements, were generally inconclusive in showing any clear differences between the accession from I. glandulifera and those from other Impatiens species. Both, nrDNA ITS and ITS2-LSU sequence analyses indicated a difference between the rust infecting I. glandulifera compared to accessions on other hosts. However, the large variations in both ITS and 28S (ITS2-LSU) sequences determined within single accessions in this study, makes a clear separation difficult. Cross-inoculation experiments, using one accession of P. komarovii ex I. glandulifera (from India) and two accessions of P. komarovii ex I. parviflora (from China and Hungary), confirmed the specificity of these strains to their original hosts. Two Himalayan Impatiens species, I. scabrida and I. brachycentra, showed varying levels of susceptibility to these rust accessions, where the former was weakly susceptible to all three accessions and the latter was weakly susceptible only to P. komarovii ex I. parviflora (from China). However, commercial cultivars of I. balsamina proved to be fully susceptible to all rust accessions, although this has not been demonstrated under field conditions in India. Based on these host specificity differences between the rust accessions, we propose a new variety: Puccinia komarovii var. glanduliferae var. nov. associated with I. glandulifera in the Himalayas.

T2  - Biological Invasions
AB  - Non-native plant species may contain allelopathic substances that might help to out-compete native vegetation. These allelochemicals may be released from live or dead plant tissues and be accumulated in the soil. We tested whether non-native species leaf litter and their leachates reduced seedling establishment and growth of native species. We subjected seeds of six native species to the effect of litter leachates of three of the most important invasive plants in Europe and to mannitol solutions with similar osmotic potential in germination chamber experiments. Additionally, we measured the effect of the same litter on emergence and growth of the native species in an outdoor pot experiment. Litter leachates delayed and reduced germination and affected initial root growth of all native species. The effects of leachates were significantly higher than those of mannitol, indicating the action of toxic, most probably allelochemical substances. Emergence of seedlings in pots was also reduced, but total biomass per pot was not affected and biomass per seedling increased. Allelochemicals may affect germination and early stages of seedling recruitment. However, these negative effects seem to cease shortly after germination, when other mechanisms such as competition may be more important. Consequently, litter-borne allelochemicals are unlikely to drive the invasion of the studied non-native species, but they may contribute to maintain mono-dominant stands reinforcing invasion success.

However, the underlying demographic mechanisms for the population declines of native plants through individual fitness components are unclear. To assess the impact of exotic plant species on the fitness components of native plants (establishment, growth, biomass, reproduction, and survival), we used a global meta-analysis of 75 articles representing 232 data points. We examined how the characteristics of native and exotic species, environmental conditions, and methodological factors modify the magnitude and direction of impacts on native fitness. We found that the impact of exotic plant species on native plants varied across fitness components. Exotic plant species generally reduced the biomass, reproduction, and survival of native plants, while they had no impact on the establishment and growth of natives. Most studies included in the data set were conducted in temperate grasslands and forests focusing on a few life-forms of exotic species, making it difficult to draw more specific conclusions of the impacts of exotic plant species on native plants. Overall, our results indicate that exotic plants may limit the population growth of co-occurring native plant species primarily by reducing the biomass, reproduction, and survival of individual plants, most likely through resource competition. To enable generalisations to be made, we suggest that the impacts of exotic plant species on native plants should be assessed based on multiple fitness components, preferably across different habitat types. Moreover, we encourage impact studies to be carried out beyond temperate regions using a wider range of exotic plant species. (C) 2015 Geobotanisches Institut ETH, Stiftung Ruebel.

AB  - The study summarizes preliminary results of an experiment focused on the impact of various plant extracts on germination and early growth of wheat grains (Triticum aestivum). The extracts were prepared from these plant species: english oak (Quercus robur, bark), caraway (Carum carvi, fruits), himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera, leaves), long turmeric (Curcuma longa, spices), ginger (Zingiber officinale, spices), giant knotweed (Reynoutria sachalinensis, leaves), japanese knotweed (R. japonica, leaves), bohemian knotweed (R. x bohemica, leaves), japanese pagoda tree (Sophora japonica, leaves) and stinging nettle (Urtica dioica, leaves). Following characteristics were observed: germination, root and above-ground lengths, biomass dry matter weight of aboveground and underground parts and root/shoot (R/S) ratio. The values of all observed characteristics showed positive effects stained grains on their initial growth. Seed germination was not different from control. Wheat grains treated with extracts from knotweed (all three species) and caraway grew the best of all. The worst grew grains treated with extract from ginger. The positive effect of treatments was observed in the ratio of R/S. So this way of treatment of grains could have had an impact on overcoming drought stress.

TI  - AN INVASIVE PLANT ALTERS POLLINATOR-MEDIATED PHENOTYPIC SELECTION ON A NATIVE CONGENER
AU  - Beans, Carolyn M.
AU  - Roach, Deborah A.
T2  - American Journal of Botany
AB  - Premise of study: Recent studies suggest that invasive plants compete reproductively with native plants by reducing the quantity or quality of pollinator visits. Although these studies have revealed ecological consequences of pollinator-mediated competition between invasive and native plants, the evolutionary outcomes of these interactions remain largely unexplored. Methods: We studied the ecological and evolutionary impact of pollinator-mediated competition with an invasive jewelweed, Impatiens glandulifera, on a co-occurring native congener, I. capensis. Using a pollinator choice experiment, a hand pollination experiment, and a selection analysis, we addressed the following questions: (1) Do native pollinators show preference for the invasive or native jewelweed, and do they move between the two species? (2) Does invasive jewelweed pollen inhibit seed production in the native plant? (3) Does the invasive jewelweed alter phenotypic selection on the native plant's floral traits? Key results: The pollinator choice experiment showed that pollinators strongly preferred the invasive jewelweed. The hand pollination experiment demonstrated that invasive pollen inhibited seed production in the native plant. The selection analysis showed that the presence of the invasive jewelweed altered phenotypic selection on corolla height in the native plant. Conclusions: Invasive plants have the potential to alter phenotypic selection on floral traits in native plant populations. If native plants can evolve in response to this altered selection pressure, the evolution of floral traits may play an important role in permitting long-term coexistence of native and invasive plants.

AB  - In a review of the role of plants in river systems, Gurnell (2014) explains how living riparian vegetation can moderate and manipulate river environments by trapping sediment and promoting longer-term stability. Although the review concentrates on perennial plants in the humid temperate zone, this commentary acts as a reminder that some plants in other kinds of fluvial environment do not act in this way. This is done by describing how Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan Balsam), a highly invasive annual plant that is now found in many countries on three separate continents, may significantly increase soil erosion along riverbanks and the riparian zone of inland watercourses.

T2  - Earth Surface Processes and Landforms
AB  - This paper is a response to commentary on the review by Gurnell (Plants as river system engineers. Earth Surface Processes and Landforms39: 4-25, 2014). It covers three themes. First, it explains how the review focused on physical ecosystem engineering by plants, particularly in the northern humid temperate zone. Second, it explains how the review was structured to address that theme and why annual species were not highlighted. Within the humid temperate zone, mature plants of annual species are not present during the seasons of the year when fluvial processes are most active: they survive as seeds or young seedlings, and so their ability to act as river ecosystem engineers is limited. Third, some comments are made regarding the annual species, Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera), including the traits that enable it to be successful in riparian environments, its competitive ability, its potential role in influencing fluvial sediment dynamics, and the need for controlled experiments to characterize and quantify the latter over one or more complete years.

AB  - In the Transylvanian region, the Aries Valley stretches along the course of the Aries River, ending as tributary of Mure River. As well as these areas of great biodiversity value, the Aries Valley (drainage area of 2,540 km(2)) also crosses the region where local people set their villages and towns and use the surrounding areas as grasslands for grazing, mowing and fields for agriculture. The grassland types are present in patches, those used for hay production are scattered among agricultural fields and human settlements. Evidence from statistical analysis of the vegetation cover of a riparian area of Aries River Valley indicates that in the inventorying plots with low species diversity, there is a dominance of one or two species with individuals unequally distributed within and between plots. The layer 1-5 m is dominated by alien invasive species: Fallopia japonica, Helianthus tuberosus, Impatiens glanduligera, the studied area of Aries River Valley becoming a source for these alien species to invade the surrounding grasslands and agricultural fields. Especially Fallopia japonica individuals form compact patches invading the pastures and agricultural fields and the local farmers cannot use the land any more for fulfilling their own needs. The invasive species replace the native species from the grasslands and make the agricultural field inappropriate for crops cultivation. The river acts as a migration corridor for the alien species helping them to spread by seeds or fragments and invade new places, especially during spring and/or autumn floods, and a contamination source for the surrounding grasslands and agricultural fields.

T2  - Biological Invasions
AB  - Whether invasion of introduced plant species may be aided by certain community properties is poorly understood for species-rich ecosystems, such as tropical montane forests. In Kenya, the non-native tree Fraxinus pennsylvanica has invaded degraded montane forests. We used generalized linear mixed models to examine the relative importance of different community properties to Fraxinus invasion after agricultural abandonment and in the secondary forest. Fraxinus invasion was positively related to plant community species diversity and the abundance of tree saplings, shrubs, ferns, and herbs in the abandoned fallows, but negatively related to the same community properties in the secondary forest. The number of Fraxinus recruits declined with declining propagule pressure in the fallows, but not in the secondary forest. Although adult and saplings of Fraxinus were positively related to community diversity in the fallows, Fraxinus appeared to decrease diversity in the secondary forest. These results show that the success of non-native species invasion and the effects of an invader on the resident community may depend both on properties and degree of disturbance of the community. Plant community diversity and evenness appeared to determine the invasion success by increasing invasibility of the abandoned fallows, but decreasing invasibility of the secondary forest. Our results from a tropical degraded forest emphasize the importance of including habitat characteristics when predicting both the potential of non-native plant invasion and effects of invasives on the particular community.

AB  - Studies of plant invasions rarely address impacts on molluscs. By comparing pairs of invaded and corresponding uninvaded plots in 96 sites in floodplain forests, we examined effects of four invasive alien plants (Impatiens glandulifera, Fallopia japonica, F. sachalinensis, and F.xbohemica) in the Czech Republic on communities of land snails. The richness and abundance of living land snail species were recorded separately for all species, rare species listed on the national Red List, and small species with shell size below 5 mm. The significant impacts ranged from 16-48% reduction in snail species numbers, and 29-90% reduction in abundance. Small species were especially prone to reduction in species richness by all four invasive plant taxa. Rare snails were also negatively impacted by all plant invaders, both in terms of species richness or abundance. Overall, the impacts on snails were invader-specific, differing among plant taxa. The strong effect of I. glandulifera could be related to the post-invasion decrease in abundance of tall nitrophilous native plant species that are a nutrient-rich food source for snails in riparian habitats. Fallopia sachalinensis had the strongest negative impact of the three knotweeds, which reflects differences in their canopy structure, microhabitat humidity and litter decomposition. The ranking of Fallopia taxa according to the strength of impacts on snail communities differs from ranking by their invasiveness, known from previous studies. This indicates that invasiveness does not simply translate to impacts of invasion and needs to be borne in mind by conservation and management authorities.

AB  - Aim Invasive alien species are a threat to biodiversity and can harm resident plants, animals, humans and infrastructure. To reduce deleterious effects, effective management planning for invasive plants is required. Currently, the effectiveness of management is primarily optimized locally through eradication of individual populations. By contrast, spatial prioritization of control activities at the landscape level has received less attention, despite its potential to improve management planning in complex landscapes, especially under budget constraints. Location North-eastern Switzerland, Europe. Methods We used a dynamic simulation model to evaluate the effectiveness of spatially designed management planning for controlling the expansion of three invasive alien plants (IAPs; Heracleum mantegazzianum, Impatiens glandulifera and Reynoutria japonica) across a heterogeneous landscape in North-eastern Switzerland. The model predicted the spread of IAPs from their current distribution under constraints of 361 control options differing in local intensity, frequency, duration, area and spatial prioritization of eradication measures. Results Our results demonstrate that IAP-control actions under a restricted budget are more effective if control actions are spatially prioritized. Most effective spatial treatments generally prioritized small populations in the case of the annual species and large populations in the case of the perennial species. Further, applying intensive control at early stages generally increased effectiveness of control. Main conclusions For IAP-management planning, our findings suggest that control should be applied early when IAPs start spreading, to maximize success or minimize costs. Further, spatial prioritization schemes are particularly useful under limited financial means for IAP-management. Finally, our modelling approach may serve as a proof of concept to evaluate the effectiveness of control actions of various IAPs in complex landscapes.

AB  - Understanding the ecology of plant species in their whole range (native and introduced) can provide insights into those that become problematic weeds in the introduced range despite being benign components of the vegetative community in the native range. We studied the morphological traits of Impatiens glandulifera in the native (Indian Himalayas) and introduced (UK) range and evaluated what influences natural enemies and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have on plant performance. We compared height, total leaf area, root: shoot ratio, natural enemy damage and the colonisation of AMF from individual plants within and between ranges twice in 2010 during the months of June and August. In addition, in August 2010, we estimated the number of reproductive units (expressed as the sum of flowers, seed capsule and seeds) at each site. We found that all morphological traits varied between populations and countries, though in general introduced populations, and the semi-natural population in India, showed higher performance compared to natural native populations. There was only an indication that natural enemy damage, which was significantly higher in the native range, negatively affected reproductive units. Within the introduced range, the percentage colonisation of AMF was negatively associated with plant performance indicating that I. glandulifera may associate with an incompatible AMF species incurring a cost to invasive populations. We conclude that species which are heavily regulated in the native range, though still show high levels of performance, should be considered undesirable introductions into similar ecoclimatic ranges due to the potential that these species will become highly invasive species.

AU  - Del Fabbro, Corina

T2  - Biological Invasions
AB  - The ability of some invasive plant species to produce biochemical compounds toxic to native species, called allelopathy, is thought to be one of the reasons for their success when introduced to a novel range, an idea known as the Novel Weapons Hypothesis. However, support for this hypothesis mainly comes from bioassays and experiments conducted under controlled environments, whereas field evidence is rare. In a field experiment, we investigated whether three plant species invasive in Europe, Solidago gigantea, Impatiens glandulifera and Erigeron annuus, inhibit the germination of native species through allelopathy more than an adjacent native plant community. At three sites for each invasive species, we compared the germination of native species that were sown on invaded and non-invaded plots. Half of these plots were amended with activated carbon to reduce the influence of potential allelopathic compounds. The germination of sown seeds and of seeds from the seedbank was monitored over a period of 9 weeks. Activated carbon generally enhanced seed germination. This effect was equally pronounced in invaded and adjacent non-invaded plots, indicating that invasive species do not suppress germination more than a native plant community. In addition, more seeds germinated from the seedbank on invaded than on non-invaded soil, probably due to previous suppression of germination by the invasive species. Our field study does not provide evidence for the Novel Weapons Hypothesis with respect to the germination success of natives. Instead, our results suggest that if invasive species release allelopathic compounds that suppress germination, they do so to a similar degree as the native plant community.

T2  - Forest Ecology and Management
AB  - Invasive plants can disrupt associations between soil organisms and native trees which may result in altered ecosystem functions, both reduced biodiversity and timber production. We examined the effect of the invasive annual plant Impatiens glandulifera on the arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis and performance of Acer pseudoplatanus saplings at three different levels of disturbance in a controlled field experiment in a deciduous forest in Switzerland. A total of 1125 one-year-old A. pseudoplatanus saplings were planted either in plots invaded by I. glandulifera, in plots from which the invasive plant had been manually removed or in plots which were not yet colonised by the invasive plant. The 45 (3 x 15) plots were equally distributed over three forest areas which were differently affected by a wind throw 12 years prior to the experiment. Saplings including their full root systems were harvested after 3, 6 and 15 months. I. glandulifera reduced AM colonisation on A. pseudoplatanus saplings by 30-43%. Reduction in AM colonisation did not differ between harvesting time and was not affected by the level of forest disturbance. Saplings growing in invaded plots also showed a reduced root biomass and survival rate compared to saplings in the other plots. Increases in soil moisture, soil pH, available phosphorus and microbial activity found in plots invaded by L glandulifera did not affect AM colonisation and performance of saplings. Our findings demonstrate that the spread of the invasive I. glandulifera in mixed deciduous forests negatively affects the symbiotic association between AM fungi and A. pseudoplatanus saplings and thus forest regeneration.

AB  - Exploring the effects of allelopathic plant chemicals on the growth of native vegetation is essential to understand their ecological roles and importance in exotic plant invasion. Naphthoquinones have been identified as potential growth inhibitors produced by Impatiens glandulifera, an exotic annual plant that recently invaded temperate forests in Europe. However, naphthoquinone release and inhibitory potential have not been examined. We quantified the naphthoquinone content in cotyledons, leaves, stems, and roots from plants of different ages of both the invasive I. glandulifera and native Impatiens noli-tangere as well as in soil extracts and rainwater rinsed from leaves of either plant species by using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). We identified the compound 2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (2-MNQ) exclusively in plant organs of I. glandulifera, in resin bags buried into the soil of patches invaded by I. glandulifera, and in rainwater rinsed from its leaves. This indicates that 2-MNQ is released from the roots of I. glandulifera and leached from its leaves by rain. Specific bioassays using aqueous shoot and root extracts revealed a strong inhibitory effect on the germination of two native forest herbs and on the mycelium growth of three ectomycorrhiza fungi. These findings suggest that the release of 2-MNQ may contribute to the invasion success of I. glandulifera and support the novel weapons hypothesis.

T2  - Biologia
AB  - The investigations of habitat conditions on the variability of selected population features in the two invasive, annuals with different life-history traits were conducted in the years 2008-2010, in the Polish part of the Carpathian Mountains in communities characterized by the gradual decrease of light availability. The individuals of Impatiens glandulifera were surveyed along roadsides, in willow thickets, as well as inside and along the edges of the riparian forest, whereas the individuals of Bidens frondosa were observed in riverside gravels characterized by a different species composition. Each year, the number and density of individuals (stems) occurring in the particular sites were examined, as well as the height and the fruit production in 30 randomly chosen stems were surveyed. Moreover, the number of seeds per fruit, the diaspore dimensions and the seedling recruitment in laboratory conditions were examined during each season. As the values of height of individuals, number of fruits per stem, number of seeds per fruit, as well as the seedling abundance in some groups were not consistent with the normal distribution and the variances were not homogeneous, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used in statistical analyses. Much greater number and density of individuals of Impatiens glandulifera were found in riparian forest, than in willow thickets and along the roadsides. In all sites the number and density of individuals increased steadily in consecutive seasons. The great number and density of Bidens frondosa individuals observed in shady and partly shady sites during the first year of studies raised in the second year and subsequently dramatically decreased in the third season. The lowest number and density of individuals noted in the first season in unshaded site raised substantially in subsequent years. The height of stems, as well as seed and fruit production of both taxa diminished with a decrease of height of neighboring plants. The seed dimensions presented the spatial and temporal variability, whereas the number of seedlings among consecutive years and in successive sites did not differ. The considerable height of the individuals of Impatiens glandulifera, high production of large fruits and seeds in open and dry roadside areas can contribute to more effective ballistic dissemination, while substantial seedling recruitment enables the colonization of new, perhaps more advantageous sites. On the other hand, lower individual height, as well as fruit and seed production and considerable seedling emergence allow the population to last and to gradually extend the area in forest communities. The considerable abundance of the high-statured Bidens frondosa individuals, substantial production of large capitula and achenes contribute to long persistence of populations in open and sun-lit sites. The gradually decrease in the height of the stems, achene number and size observed in partly-shaded and shaded places might allow to long-distance dispersal of seeds by animals, while substantial seedling recruitment might contribute to establishment in new areas.

AU  - Greenwood, Philip

T2  - Journal of Soils and Sediments
AB  - The invasive plant, Impatiens glandulifera (common English name: Himalayan Balsam), is now found in many river catchments in most European countries. Its preference for damp, nutrient-rich soils, along with its intolerance to cold weather and rapid dieback, has implicated it in promoting soil erosion along the riparian zone. Despite the implication, its influence on the sediment dynamics of river systems remains unconfirmed. This communication reports the preliminary findings of ongoing work to investigate a possible link between I. glandulifera and accelerated erosion rates in inland river systems. Erosion pins, a micro-profile bridge, and a digital caliper were employed to measure changes in the soil surface profile (SSP) at six separate locations, each contaminated with I. glandulifera, along the riparian zone of a small watercourse in northwest Switzerland. Changes in SSP were also measured at an identical number of nearby locations supporting natural vegetation, in order to establish baseline erosion conditions. Soil surface profiles at all 12 locations were re-measured on seven separate occasions, from October 2012 to May 2013. This covers the time before dieback occurred to the germination and seasonal regrowth of new plants. A total of 720 individual SSP measurements were recorded during the above monitoring period. Increasingly negative values relative to initial values were documented at most transects, indicating a net reduction in soil surface elevations. This is interpreted as evidence of the removal (i.e., erosion) of surface material. Paired samples statistical analysis of the data indicate that erosion from contaminated sites was significantly greater than erosion from topographically comparable reference sites (t =-5.758; P < 0.05; N = 359) supporting natural vegetation. The results provide tentative yet compelling evidence that I. glandulifera promotes soil erosion along the riparian zone of the watercourse investigated. Given the unrelenting spread of this notoriously invasive plant throughout inland river systems in many countries, the likelihood of greater quantities of nutrient-rich sediment entering into aquatic environments may steadily reduce water quality in all affected catchments. An absence of effective control measures capable of halting or even slowing its rate of invasion may make it increasingly difficult for affected European Union member states to meet and then maintain key water quality standards set by the Water Framework Directive (WFD) when fully implemented in 2015.

AB  - This study provides evidence on integrating the morphological, field, and laboratory data, and application of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) barcoding gene to the three asexual or sexual Lysiphlebus spp., i.e., Lysiphlebus cardui (Marshall), Lysiphlebus confusus Tremblay and Eady and Lysiphlebus fabarum (Marshall) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae). New aphid-invasive plant association, Aphis fabae Scopoli (Hemipreta: Aphididae) on Impatiens glandulifera Royle, has been used in the same model area in the Czech Republic under the same sampling and rearing method for several consecutive years and throughout the season. For molecular identification of these three species, we used DNA sequences of the barcoding region of the mitochondrial COI gene. Although our results confirmed ecological and morphological differences among L. cardui, L. confusus, and L. fabarum, genetic analysis on the basis of COI mitochondrial barcoding gene does not support species status of the mentioned Lysiphlebus taxa. The level of morphological differentiation in these Lysiphlebus Forster species is in accordance with the usual species variability within subfamily Aphidiinae. However, it should be examined how appearance of asexual lineages affects the morphological or genetical variability.

AB  - Invasive plants can disturb interactions between soil organisms and native plants and thereby alter ecosystem functions and/or reduce local biodiversity. Collembola and Acari are the most abundant microarthropods in the leaf litter and soil playing a key role in the decomposition of organic material and nutrient cycling. We designed a field experiment to examine the potential effects of the annual invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera on species diversity, abundance and community composition of Collembola and Acari in leaf litter and soil in a deciduous forest in Switzerland. Leaf litter and soil samples were obtained from plots invaded by I. glandulifera since 6 years, from plots in which the invasive plant had been removed for 4 years and from plots which were not yet colonized by the invasive plant. The 45 leaf litter and soil samples were equally distributed over three forest areas, which were differently affected by a wind throw 12 years prior to sampling representing a natural gradient of disturbance. Collembola species richness and abundance in the leaf litter and soil samples were not affected by the presence of the invasive plant. However, the species composition of Collembola was altered in plots with I. glanduIllera. The abundance of leaf-litter dwelling Acari was increased in invaded plots compared to the two other plot types. Furthermore, the presence of the invasive plant shifted the composition of Acari individuals belonging to different groups. Our field experiment demonstrates that an annual invasive plant can affect microarthropods which are important for nutrient cycling in various ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

T2  - Biological Invasions
AB  - Plant invasiveness was commonly attributed to the invader's competitive superiority over the native community, but a general pattern supporting this prediction is still lacking. This is particularly enhanced by the fact that competitive dominance and its role in plant invasiveness require the use of scarcely-practiced experimental elements. Here, we used a comprehensive experimental approach to evaluate the competitive superiority of the highly invasive annual Impatiens glandulifera. We used two competition-setting treatments, which independently examine competitive effect versus response of both native and invasive genotypes. As a neighbour species we used Urtica dioica, a vigorous perennial co-occurring with I. glandulifera at both its native and introduced ranges. By examining both components of competitive ability we were able to show that although invasive genotypes exert a weaker competitive pressure compared to their native conspecifics, they are still competitively superior to U. dioica. Our results also suggest that the high competitive ability of I. glandulifera could be attributed it to allelopathic effects on co-occurring native species. We suggest that an appropriate experimental setup, which examines competitive effect and response independently, can provide a more factual evaluation of the competitive ability of invasive plants. Furthermore, the use of a dominant species as a target plant rather than a random species or one with poor competitive ability, renders our results more general, implying that I. glandulifera might exert greater competitive effect on the less robust co-occurring species. We conclude that our approach is highly useful and advocate its application in future tests of invasion success.

T2  - Biological Invasions
AB  - The genus Impatiens (Balsaminaceae) includes three widespread species in the Czech Republic, central Europe: the native I. noli-tangere, and two invasive species, I. parviflora and I. glandulifera, differing in the dynamics of invasion. They all occur in similar habitats and share basic life-history characteristics, which make them a suitable model for studying species traits associated with invasiveness. In this study we investigated differences in habitat requirements of these Impatiens species, their coexistence and short-term population dynamics in the field. We established 84 1 x 1 m permanent plots in five localities where all three species co-occurred. In each plot vascular plant species were determined, their cover estimated and all individuals of Impatiens species counted. Site characteristics including tree canopy cover, soil moisture, nitrogen and carbon content, and slope were measured directly. Nutrients, light, humidity and soil reaction were estimated using Ellenberg indicator values. The presence of I. noli-tangere was strongly correlated with high soil moisture, that of I. parviflora with high tree canopy cover and low soil moisture. Impatiens glandulifera exhibited a unimodal response to tree canopy cover, avoiding both very shaded and fully open sites. The current-year abundances of all species were negatively related to those of congeneric species. These results suggest that the coexistence of Impatiens species in the same habitat is due to microsite differentiation. Further spread of I. glandulifera to new habitats, and reduction of the native I. noli-tangere niche, can be expected in areas where the latter species co-occurs with competitively strong invasive congeners.

AB  - Riparian systems are prone to invasion by alien plant species. The spread of invasive riparian plants may be facilitated by hydrochory, the transport of seeds by water, but while ecological studies have highlighted the possible role of upstream source populations in the establishment and persistence of stands of invasive riparian plant species, population genetic studies have as yet not fully addressed the potential role of hydrochoric dispersal in such systems. A population genetics approach based on a replicated bifurcate sampling design is used to test hypotheses consistent with patterns of unidirectional, linear gene flow expected under hydrochoric dispersal of the invasive riparian plant Impatiens glandulifera in two contrasting river systems. A significant increase in levels of genetic diversity downstream was observed, consistent with the accumulation of propagules from upstream source populations, and strong evidence was found for organization of this diversity between different tributaries, reflecting the dendritic organization of the river systems studied. These findings indicate that hydrochory, rather than anthropogenic dispersal, is primarily responsible for the spread of I. glandulifera in these river systems, and this is relevant to potential approaches to the control of invasive riparian plant species.

T2  - Annals of Botany
AB  - Local adaptation enables plant species to persist under different environmental conditions. Evolutionary change can occur rapidly in invasive annual species and has been shown to lead to local adaptation. However, the patterns and mechanisms of local adaptation in invasive species along colonization sequences are not yet understood. Thus, in this study the alien annual Impatiens glandulifera was used to investigate local adaptation to distinct habitats that have been consecutively invaded in central Europe. A reciprocal transplant experiment was performed using 15 populations from alluvial deciduous forests, fallow meadows and coniferous upland forests, and a greenhouse experiment was performed in which plants from these habitats were grown under treatments reflecting the main habitat differentiators (shade, soil acidity, competition). Biomass production, specific leaf area, plant height and relative growth rate differed between habitats in the field experiment and between treatments in the greenhouse, but not between seed origins. Overall, there was no indication of local adaptation in either experiment. Since I. glandulifera is a successful invader in many habitats without showing local adaptation, it is suggested that the species is coping with environmental variation by means of high phenotypic plasticity. The species seems to follow a jack-and-master strategy, i.e. it is able to maintain high fitness under a wide range of environmental conditions, but performs particularly well in favourable habitats. Therefore, the proposed colonization sequence is likely to be based primarily on changes in propagule pressure. It is concluded that invasive alien plants can become dominant in distinct habitats without local adaptation.

T2  - Journal of Vegetation Science
AB  - QuestionsThe high competitiveness of exotic invasive species has often been demonstrated, but usually with respect to native species known to have low competitive ability. Considering five exotic and five native riparian species with close characteristics regarding competitive ability, habitat and growth form, we addressed the following questions: (i) do the selected invasive plants produce more biomass than the selected native dominants under competitive pressure; and (ii) are the selected invasive species better competitors than the selected native dominants? LocationCommon garden experiment at the Henri Gaussen Botanical Garden, Toulouse, France. MethodsWe selected five native dominant species and five exotic invasive species co-occurring along a riparian successional gradient of the middle Garonne River (SW France). Young plants of each species were planted in pots in ten intra- and 17 inter-specific combinations in conditions of high water and nutrient availability. To simulate the effects of hydrological disturbance during earlier growth stages, a partial cutting of plants was applied 6weeks after planting. We measured above-ground and below-ground biomass of individuals of each species after 6mo of growth. ResultsThere were large disparities among species performances, regardless of whether the species were exotic or native. The exotic species produced more above-ground and below-ground biomass than the natives species for 73% of the selected species pairs. The exotic species had higher competitive ability than the native species, mainly related to the high competitive effect of I.glandulifera. The two species with the highest biomass production and competitive ability were invasive exotics, whereas the two species with the lowest were dominant natives. ConclusionsOur results predict that competition among young individuals could play a major role for the invasion success of the studied exotic species in European riparian areas.

AB  - Methanolic extract from lyophilized roots of Impatiens glandulifera Royle was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography using DAD and FLD detection and this revealed one dominant highly fluorescent very unstable substance. The stability of this derivative is strongly dependent on the plant material drying procedure and extraction procedure used. The structure of the substance was established as 1,2,4-trihydroxynaphthalene-1-O-glucoside (THNG) according LC-MS and NMR measurements. When lyophilized plant material was extracted with methanol an almost four times higher amount of THNG was found in the extract, compared to the amount of 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone obtained, while in the case of the same lyophilized plant material extracted with water there was no THNG in the extract. The main compounds in this case was 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone. In the plant material dried at the laboratory temperature and extracted by methanol there are only traces of THNG.

AB  - We studied genetic diversity within and among populations of warty cabbage (Bunias orientalis L.), which is an alien species in Lithuania and other Baltic countries. In Lithuania, this weed colonises two main types of habitats: railway/roadsides and meadows on riversides. The aim of this study was to assess the genetic structure of invasive populations of B. orientalis in Lithuania and consider the impact of diverse habitats on the partitioning of genetic diversity using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) carried our on the basis of ISSR showed that there is high genetic differentiation (46%) among populations of B. orientalis, which is probably caused by the founder effect and limited gene flow. However, we observed no impact of habitat on the genetic difference among populations. Similar levels of ISSR polymorphic loci were observed in riverside (P = 31.67%) and railway/roadsides (P = 30.51%) populations. UPGMA cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) also did not show grouping of studied populations according to habitat type. High genetic differentiation among populations, as indicated by ISSR markers, confirm multiple independent introductions of this species in Lithuania.

AB  - Vegetation community composition and the above-and below-ground invertebrate communities are linked intrinsically, though few studies have assessed the impact of non-native plants on both these parts of the community together. We evaluated the differences in the above- (foliage- and ground-dwelling) and below-ground invertebrate communities in nine uninvaded plots and nine plots invaded by the annual invasive species Impatiens glandulifera, in the UK during 2007 and 2008. Over 139,000 invertebrates were identified into distinct taxa and categorised into functional feeding groups. The impact of I. glandulifera on the vegetation and invertebrate community composition was evaluated using multivariate statistics including principal response curves (PRC) and redundancy analysis (RDA). In the foliage-dwelling community, all functional feeding groups were less abundant in the invaded plots, and the species richness of Coleoptera and Heteroptera was significantly reduced. In the ground-dwelling community, herbivores, detritivores, and predators were all significantly less abundant in the invaded plots. In contrast, these functional groups in the below-ground community appeared to be largely unaffected, and even positively associated with the presence of I. glandulifera. Although the cover of I. glandulifera decreased in the invaded plots in the second year of the study, only the below-ground invertebrate community showed a significant response. These results indicate that the above-and below-ground invertebrate communities respond differently to the presence of I. glandulifera, and these community shifts can potentially lead to a habitat less biologically diverse than surrounding native communities; which could have negative impacts on higher trophic levels and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Effects of alien plant invaders on native ecosystems are widely acknowledged, although the evidence is sometimes speculative, especially in riparian zones. We examined the changes in floristic diversity, stand structure and composition of resident species associated with invasions of Eucalyptus camaldulensis in riparian zones of the Western Cape, South Africa. Using a gradient comparative approach, we compared the richness, diversity (H') and evenness (J) of resident vegetation in a riparian forest under varying levels of E. camaldulensis percentage canopy cover. We found that species richness, diversity and structural attributes (e.g. height, relative cover and mean basal area) of native species decreased consistently along the invasion gradient. However, evenness did not change significantly with increasing Eucalyptus invasion. Invasion by E. camaldulensis was associated with changes in native plant species composition; although some native species occurred in alien invaded sites, they were more abundant in uninvaded sites. This research offers a baseline from which further experimental work can be conducted to determine the mechanisms responsible for changes attributed to Eucalyptus invasion. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Quantitative assessments of alien plant impacts are essential to inform management to ensure that resources are prioritized against the most problematic species and that restoration targets the worst-affected ecosystem processes. Here, we present the first detailed critique of quantitative field studies of alien plant impacts and highlight biases in the biogeography and life form of the target species, the responses assessed, and the extent to which spatial variability is addressed. Observed impacts often fail to translate to ecosystem services or evidence of environmental degradation. The absence of overarching hypotheses regarding impacts has reduced the consistency of approaches worldwide and prevented the development of predictive tools. Future studies must ensure that the links between species traits, ecosystem stocks, and ecosystem flows, as well as ecosystem services, are explicitly defined.

TI  - The impact of two non-native plant species on native flora performance: potential implications for habitat restoration
AU  - Tanner, Robert A.
AU  - Gange, Alan C.
T2  - Plant Ecology
AB  - Both Impatiens glandulifera and Fallopia japonica are highly invasive plant species that have detrimental impacts on native biodiversity in areas where they invade and form dense monocultures. Both species are weakly dependent on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) for their growth and, therefore, under monotypic stands, the AMF network can become depauperate. We evaluated the impact of I. glandulifera and F. japonica on the performance (expressed as shoot biomass) of three UK native species (Plantago lanceolata, Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium pratense) grown in soil collected from under stands of both invasive plants and compared to plants grown in soil from under stands of the corresponding native vegetation. All native species had a higher percentage colonisation of AMF when grown in uninvaded soil compared to the corresponding invaded soil. P. lanceolata and L. corniculatus had a higher biomass when grown in uninvaded soil compared to corresponding invaded soil indicating an indirect impact from the non-native species. However, for T. pratense there was no difference in biomass between soil types related to I. glandulifera, suggesting that the species is more reliant on rhizobial bacteria. We conclude that simply managing invasive populations of non-native species that are weakly, or non-dependent, on AMF is inadequate for habitat restoration as native plant colonisation and establishment may be hindered by the depleted levels of AMF in the soil below invaded monocultures. We suggest that the reintroduction of native plants to promote AMF proliferation should be incorporated into future management plans for habitats degraded by non-native plant species.

AB  - Invasive species can have far-reaching impacts on ecosystems. Invasive plants may be able to change habitat structure and quality. We conducted a field experiment to examine whether the invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera affects native terrestrial gastropods. We also evaluated whether the invasive plant alters forest soil characteristics and microclimate which in turn may influence gastropod abundance. We sampled gastropods in plots installed in patches of I. glandulifera, in plots in which I. glandulifera was regularly removed by hand, and in control plots which were not yet colonized by the invasive plant. The three types of plots were equally distributed over three mixed deciduous forest areas that were slightly, moderately or heavily affected by a wind throw 11 years ago. A total of 33 gastropod species were recorded. Gastropod species richness was not affected by delayed effects of the wind throw, but it was significantly higher in invaded plots than in uninvaded plots. Similarly, gastropod abundance was higher in invaded plots than in the two types of control plots. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed marginally significant shifts of gastropod communities between the three types of plots and indicated that soil moisture, presence of I. glandulifera and cover of woody debris affected gastropod species composition. Field measurements showed that soil moisture was higher and daily soil temperature was more damped in patches of I. glandulifera than in the native ground vegetation. The changed microclimatic conditions may favour certain gastropod species. In particular, ubiquitous species and species with a high inundation tolerance increased in abundance in plots invaded by I. glandulifera. Our field experiment demonstrated that an invasive plant can indirectly affect native organisms by changing soil characteristics and microclimate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Europe has a particularly long history of land protection measures, and is the region of the world with the largest number of protected areas, which has grown rapidly over the last decades. This was to a large extent due to the Natura 2000 programme of the European Union which focused on extending the existing network of legally protected areas with other habitats of conservation value. As a result, Europe has over 120,000 nationally designated protected sites (the most in the world) and 21 % of the continent area (1,228,576 km 2) currently enjoys some form of legal protection. Despite these impressive statistics, the effectiveness of the existing network in protecting biodiversity is constrained by habitat fragmentation and other factors. Despite the generally high awareness of the importance of biodiversity protection in Europe, invasive alien species are not perceived as the most pressing problem by the public. This is in contrast with the fact that many of them have serious impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in protected areas. Among these, Ailanthus altissima, Fallopia taxa, Heracleum mantegazzianum, Impatiens glandulifera and Robinia pseudoacacia are considered as top invaders by managers of protected areas. Surprisingly, continent-wide rigorous data on the distribution and abundance of invasive alien species are lacking and there is an urgent need for collating checklists of alien species using standardised criteria to record their status. With the exception of very few regions such information is missing, or incomplete, based on varying criteria and scattered in grey literature and unpublished reports. To put the management on a more scientific basis the collection and curation of better data is an urgent priority; this could be done by using existing instruments of the EU as a convenient platform. As found by means of a web survey reported here, managers of protected areas in Europe are well aware of the seriousness of the problem and threats imposed by invasive plant species but are constrained in their efforts by the lack of resources, both staff and financial, and that of rigorous scientific information translated into practical guidelines.

AB  - Positive correlation between seed weight and germination capacity is common for the vast majority of species. It is also known that seed weight can vary along a latitudinal gradient. The seed mass of the invasive Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera), which is native to East Asia, was examined in relation to distinct geographical regions in Poland (Bielsko-Biala: N49 degrees 52'32", E18 degrees 57'43"; Katowice: N50 degrees 12'8.3", E18 degrees 57'26"; Tworkow: N50 degrees 01'22", E18 degrees 15'28"); Hungary (Rum: N47 degrees 06'41", E16 degrees 50'45"; Rabahidveg: N47 degrees 03'54", E16 degrees 44'59") and Germany (Halle: N51 degrees 28'47", E11 degrees 57'12"; Marburg: N50 degrees 48'32", E8 degrees 46'31"). The study revealed that seed mass varied both among the countries and among specific populations within Poland and Germany. In Hungary, the 50 seed lots were the lightest 0.29 g and 0.31 g in respective localities and the heaviest in single populations in Poland - 0.61 g and in Germany - 0.57 g. In the present study, populations located more southwards had the lightest seeds in contrast to the commonly encountered pattern. Higher temperature, lower precipitation and as a consequence, a shortage of water can be crucial factors that affect the seed mass of I. glandulifera. Taking into account the lower frequency and abundance of the species in Hungary, the lower seed mass may probably conribute to the limited distribution range in this region.

AB  - Clements, D. R. and DiTommaso, A. 2012. Predicting weed invasion in Canada under climate change: Evaluating evolutionary potential. Can. J. Plant Sci. 92: 1013-1020. Many weed species have already advanced northward from the United States into Canada, and their number threatens to increase with warming trends under climate change. For many weed species, this range expansion can be attributed to evolutionary adaptation by northern populations occurring in areas experiencing warmer climates and longer growing seasons in recent decades. In this paper, we examine the potential for invasive plant species to be selected for one or more of 10 character traits: (1) high growth rate, (2) wide climatic or environmental tolerance, (3) short generation time, (4) prolific or consistent reproduction, (5) small seed size, (6) effective dispersal, (7) uniparental reproduction capacity, (8) no specialized germination requirements, (9) high competitive ability, and (10) effective defenses against natural enemies. If any one of these traits is selected for in an invasive species, it would provide the affected species with the potential for a more expansive invasion range than anticipated by models that assume a static genotype. Four weed species of interest exhibiting potential northward range expansion within North America were evaluated: an obligatory outcrossing annual dicot, Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandilifera Royle), a mostly selling annual dicot, velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medic.), a perennial dicot that reproduces via rhizomes but forms fertile hybrids, Japanese knotweed [Fallopia japonica (Houtt.) Ronse Decr.], and a primarily selling perennial grass, johnsongrass [Sorghum halapense (L.) Pers.]. Evidence for potential evolutionary responses to climate change was observed among particular traits for each of the four species, despite population genetic differences. The population genetics of invasive plants are difficult to model, as is climate change itself, but consideration of weed evolution to whatever degree possible should lead to improved predictive power of such models.

T2  - Annals of Botany
AB  - Background and Aims Invasiveness of some alien plants is associated with their traits, plastic responses to environmental conditions and interpopulation differentiation. To obtain insights into the role of these processes in contributing to variation in performance, we compared congeneric species of Impatiens (Balsaminaceae) with different origin and invasion status that occur in central Europe. Methods Native I. noli-tangere and three alien species (highly invasive I. glandulifera, less invasive I. parviflora and potentially invasive I. capensis) were studied and their responses to simulated canopy shading and different nutrient and moisture levels were determined in terms of survival and seedling traits. Key Results and Conclusions Impatiens glandulifera produced high biomass in all the treatments and the control, exhibiting the 'Jack-and-master' strategy that makes it a strong competitor from germination onwards. The results suggest that plasticity and differentiation occurred in all the species tested and that along the continuum from plasticity to differentiation, the species at the plasticity end is the better invader. The most invasive species I. glandulifera appears to be highly plastic, whereas the other two less invasive species, I. parviflora and I. capensis, exhibited lower plasticity but rather strong population differentiation. The invasive Impatiens species were taller and exhibited higher plasticity and differentiation than native I. noli-tangere. This suggests that even within one genus, the relative importance of the phenomena contributing to invasiveness appears to be species'specific.

TI  - Plant communities and the reproductive success of native plants after the invasion of an ornamental herb
AU  - Ramula, Satu

T2  - Biological Invasions
AB  - The effects of plant invasions on plant communities are often assessed at a few sites or in a particular type of habitat, while studies in different habitat types are scarce. We investigated plant communities in the presence and absence of the invasive ornamental herb, Lupinus polyphyllus, in four habitat types: meadow, forest, road verge and wasteland, in two geographic regions by comparing vascular plant species richness, vegetation structure based on species traits, community composition and the reproductive success of native plant species at invaded and non-invaded locations. The invader was associated with declines in the number of vascular plant species in all habitat types but was unassociated with differences in plant community composition in terms of species identity or species relative cover. However, sites with large lupin invasions (a parts per thousand yen1,000 m(2)) contained fewer vascular plant species, a larger proportion of clonal species and more lighter-seeded species than sites with small invasions. The reproductive output of native plants varied across habitats from declines to increases in the presence of L. polyphyllus, and depended on species status (meadow, non-meadow species) rather than species identity, with meadow species generally showing an increase in the reproductive output in the presence of the invader. Overall, our results demonstrate that lupin invasions are associated with declines in local plant species richness across habitats. Although we did not detect systematic differences in species composition between invaded and non-invaded locations, species with particular traits may still be more persistent in invaded plant communities than others.

AU  - Kaitera, Juha

T2  - Canadian Journal of Forest Research-Revue Canadienne De Recherche Forestiere
AB  - We explored the potential of the North European flora and some garden plants growing naturally outside Europe to support a reservoir of pine stem rusts. Live plants and detached leaves of 35 species in 16 families (Solanaceae, Verbenaceae, Grossulariaceae, Paeoniaceae, Balsaminaceae, Gentianaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Loasaceae, Tropaeolaceae, Acanthaceae, Myricaceae, Phrymaceae, Plantaginaceae, Orobanchaceae, Apocynaceae, and Fagaceae) were inoculated in the greenhouse and (or) laboratory with aeciospores of Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch. and Cronartium flaccidum (Alb. & Schwein) G. Winter in 2010. Cronartium flaccidum produced uredinia and (or) telia in 14 species in nine families, 11 of which represent new alternate hosts in Finland and nine also elsewhere (excluding Nemesia versicolor and Tropaeolum majus L.): Euphrasia stricta D. Wof. ex J.F. Lehm., N. versicolor E. Mey. ex Benth., Nemesia strumosa Benth., Verbena x hybrida Voss., Verbena officinalis L., Veronica longifolia L., Impatiens glandulifera Royle, T. majus, Loasa triphylla Juss., Asclepias incarnata L., and Bartsia alpina L. Cronartium ribicola formed fruitbodies in nine species and cultivars in five families, five of which are new alternate hosts for this species in Finland and also elsewhere: Mentzelia lindleyi Torr. & A. Gray, A. incarnata, B. alpina, L. triphylla, and T. majus. Both species of Cronartium infected four alternate hosts, each in its own family. The alternate host range of each Cronartium was wider than expected and wider than that previously described. In local natural forests, Euphrasia, Veronica, and Bartsia (in northern Finland) are potential hosts that are common and may be able to spread these rusts. The recently established ornamental I. glandulifera could provide the means to spread C. flaccidum to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in southern Finland, and species of Mentzelia may be important for the spread of C. ribicola.

TI  - Complex interactions between the wind and ballistic seed dispersal in Impatiens glandulifera (Royle)
AU  - Chapman, Daniel S.

T2  - Journal of Ecology
AB  - 1. A mechanistic understanding of seed dispersal is important for understanding and predicting dispersal patterns and spatial population dynamics. We analysed a mechanistic model for the ballistic dispersal of the widespread invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera. The model deterministically simulates individual seed trajectories, including the interaction between seeds and atmospheric winds. It is fully specified using independently measured plant traits and wind velocities. 2. To parameterise the model, we conducted field surveys and analysed high-speed video footage of seed release. We explicitly incorporated intraspecific variation in key biological parameters (seed size and mass, release height, velocity and direction), as well as variation in wind velocities. This parameter variation introduces process-based stochasticity to the deterministic model, allowing the derivation of population-level dispersal kernels. 3. Analysis of the parameterised model showed complex interactions between plant dispersal parameters and wind conditions. For example, the optimal seed launch angle in still wind is 32 degrees above horizontal, but this rises in stronger tailwinds. In a headwind, it can be optimal to either launch the seed straight upwards or slightly below the horizontal. Headwinds also blow projected seeds back towards the source, initially decreasing but then increasing net dispersal distance, which can reverse the positive effect of seed release height on dispersal distance. 4. To validate the model, we performed a field experiment in which seeds were trapped up to 6 m from potted I. glandulifera plants. Seed dispersal was biased in the direction of the prevailing wind, which was only reproduced by simulations of the model that included the wind modification of ballistic trajectories. The correspondence between the model and the data was good (R2 = 0.882), but improved if seed release was biased to occur in more windy conditions (R2 = 0.945) as might occur through mechanical disturbance to the seed pods. 5. Synthesis. Our validated model provides a functional understanding of seed dispersal in I. glandulifera. The model reveals surprisingly complex interactions between the ballistic dispersal mechanism and the wind and shows how population-level dispersal patterns emerge from intraspecific variation in dispersal traits.

AB  - The consequences of replacement of native dominants by alien species (Ailanthus altissima, Ficus carica, Robinia pseudoacacia, Acer negundo, and Amorpha fruticosa) in the tree and shrub layers have been studied in riparian forests of the Western Caucasus. The results show that the invasive dominant species do not always achieve higher abundance, compared with native dominants. When this is the case, however, the dominance of alien species as stronger competitors leads to reduction in the species richness of communities, because they not only intercept the greater part of resources from the environment but also provoke increasingly strict partitioning of remaining resources among associated species.

AB  - Pests, diseases and weeds cause significant impact on crops and natural vegetation each year. Climate change is likely to cause a spread of tropical and sub-tropical species into temperate areas and to increase the numbers of many temperate species currently limited by low temperatures at high altitudes. The potential expansion of geographical ranges of pest species will be disruptive to quarantine barriers and is likely to result in increased damage to crops and natural vegetation in previously pest free areas. Elm Leaf Beetle Pyrrhalta luteola (Mueller) is been reported to increase due to 0.3 degrees C rise in temperature and 3-4% decrease in rainfall in the Moist Himalayan Forest of Pakistan. The insect attacks Impatience gladulifera Royle., a plant of medicinal importance. The plant is not only used in a variety of local medicines but is also one of the important constituent of undergrowth natural vegetation in these forests. During the last 10 years the leaf damaged cased by the insect is on a hike and has increased up to 85%.

AB  - With the growing body of literature assessing the impact of invasive alien plants on resident species and ecosystems, a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between invasive species traits and environmental settings of invasion on the characteristics of impacts is needed. Based on 287 publications with 1551 individual cases that addressed the impact of 167 invasive plant species belonging to 49 families, we present the first global overview of frequencies of significant and non-significant ecological impacts and their directions on 15 outcomes related to the responses of resident populations, species, communities and ecosystems. Species and community outcomes tend to decline following invasions, especially those for plants, but the abundance and richness of the soil biota, as well as concentrations of soil nutrients and water, more often increase than decrease following invasion. Data mining tools revealed that invasive plants exert consistent significant impacts on some outcomes (survival of resident biota, activity of resident animals, resident community productivity, mineral and nutrient content in plant tissues, and fire frequency and intensity), whereas for outcomes at the community level, such as species richness, diversity and soil resources, the significance of impacts is determined by interactions between species traits and the biome invaded. The latter outcomes are most likely to be impacted by annual grasses, and by wind pollinated trees invading mediterranean or tropical biomes. One of the clearest signals in this analysis is that invasive plants are far more likely to cause significant impacts on resident plant and animal richness on islands rather than mainland. This study shows that there is no universal measure of impact and the pattern observed depends on the ecological measure examined. Although impact is strongly context dependent, some species traits, especially life form, stature and pollination syndrome, may provide a means to predict impact, regardless of the particular habitat and geographical region invaded.

AU  - Deegan, Robert D.
T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
AB  - Fracture is a highly dissipative process in which much of the stored elastic energy is consumed in the creation of new surfaces. Surprisingly, many plants use fracture to launch their seeds despite its seemingly prohibitive energy cost. Here we use Impatiens glandulifera as model case to study the impact of fracture on a plant's throwing capacity. I. glandulifera launches its seeds with speeds up to 4 m/s using cracks to trigger an explosive release of stored elastic energy. We find that the seed pod is optimally designed to minimize the cost of fracture. These characteristics may account for its success at invading Europe and North America.

T2  - Biological Invasions
AB  - Besides competition for abiotic resources, an increasing number of studies show evidence of the effects of invasive species on the pollination success and reproductive output of indigenous species. We studied the effect of the invasive Impatiens glandulifera Royle on the process of reproduction in the indigenous Lythrum salicaria L. and Alisma plantago-aquatica L. and the naturalized Oenothera biennis L. The latter three species (target species) were transplanted into pots and placed in invaded and non-invaded areas. During flowering season of each of these species, we measured species composition and abundance of pollinators, pollinator behaviour, pollen deposition and female reproductive output of the target species. Competitive effects were found for L. salicaria, in which fewer pollinator species and number of foraging individuals were observed, and also, lower pollen deposition and seed set were measured in these invaded populations. In contrast, the reproductive success of A. plantago-aquatica and O. biennis was not affected by the presence of I. glandulifera. Our data indicate that when invasive and indigenous species show a large overlap in pollinator community, which is the case for I. glandulifera and L. salicaria, competition between these species can occur. When both species have a different pollinator community, pollination success and reproductive output is not affected, even when the indigenous populations are densely and abundantly invaded.

AB  - In this chapter, we evaluate nonnative invasive plant species of the urban-rural-natural area gradient in order to reduce negative impacts of invasive plants on native species and ecosystems. This evaluation includes addressing (i) the concept of urban areas as the primary source of invasive plant species and characteristics of urban nonnative plants, including their documented impacts on associated native plants and biodiversity along the urban-rural-natural area gradient, (ii) the most vulnerable land uses and potential barriers to invasion along the urban-rural-natural area gradient, and (iii) possible mitigation of invasions and urbanization using restoration or rehabilitation. Finally, we introduce three possible solutions: (i) use of spatially explicit land use planning and management that places invasion barriers between the urban core and the rural-natural area interfaces, (ii) increasing native and exotic species interactions within the urban core and rural-natural area interface, thereby increasing the number of pathogen and enemy interactions or the loss of novel weapons, and (iii) changing the horticultural trade and people's behavior, such that propagule pressure is kept below threshold levels required by growing invasive plant populations.

AB  - Biomass allocation and leaf attributes are traits that discriminate between plants that exploit different light resource environments. Disturbed and high light environments provide easy access for resource-demanding, fast-growing invasive species. Comparing growth, ecophysiological and reproductive characteristics between invasives and non-invasives could help to predict a species' invasiveness and identify which habitat would be most susceptible to its invasion. In a common garden experiment we compared traits in Impatiens species that vary in their invasive status. They were the aggressive invader Impatiens glandulifera, which is invasive in mainland Europe and Ireland, I. parviflora, invasive in Central and Northern Europe but only established and not invasive in Ireland, and I. balfourii, naturalised in central and southern Europe but not reported in Ireland. We aimed to investigate their ecological requirements and to identify which traits promote invasion in this genus in a high-resource environment. Photosynthetic and allometric traits characterised the contrasting investment in light harvesting and carbon fixation of I. parviflora and I. glandulifera. The comparison of reproductive, photosynthetic and growth characteristics explained I. glandulifera's superior invasiveness when compared to I. parvilflora. However, there was no evidence that the invasive performed better than the non-invasive when it was compared to I. balfourii. Other traits that were not considered in this study, such as germination characteristics and adaptability, might also be responsible for invasiveness. We conclude that I. balfourii may possess an intrinsic invasiveness that, due to differences in invasion history, may not have reached its full potential yet.

AB  - Biological plant invasions pose a serious threat to native biodiversity and have received much attention, especially in terrestrial habitats. In freshwater ecosystems impacts of invasive plant species are less studied. We hypothesized an impact on organisms from the water column and from the sediment. We then assessed the impact of three aquatic invasive species on the plants and macroinvertebrates: Hydrocotyle ranunculoides, Ludwigia grandiflora and Myriophyllum aquaticum. Our research on 32 ponds in Belgium indicated that the reduction in the native plant species richness was a common pattern to invasion. However, the magnitude of impacts were species specific. A strong negative relationship to invasive species cover was found, with submerged vegetation the most vulnerable to the invasion. Invertebrate richness, diversity and abundance were measured in sediments of invaded and uninvaded ponds along a gradient of H. ranunculoides, L. grandiflora, and M. aquaticum species cover. We found a strong negative relationship between invasive species cover and invertebrate abundance, probably due to unsuitable conditions of the detritus for invertebrate colonization. Taxonomic compositions of aquatic invertebrate assemblages in invaded ponds differed from uninvaded ponds. Sensitive benthos, such as mayflies were completely absent in invaded ponds. The introduction of H. ranunculoides, L. grandiflora, and M. aquaticum in Belgian ponds has caused significant ecological alterations in the aquatic vegetation and the detritus community of ponds.

AB  - We examined the influence of the invasive species Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle on the understory of the Fontainebleau forest, a pen-urban forest of Paris (France), by comparing invaded versus control plots. We performed floristic inventories in fixed plots around the base of A. altissima vs native trees in different habitat types of the forest. Our findings suggest that the understory vegetation is significantly poorer and more common under A. altissima than under the other tree species and that the floristic composition is significantly different. Furthermore, the number of A. altissima root suckers growing in the plots was significantly negatively correlated with floristic richness. This effect can be attributed to both interspecific competition and allelopathic properties of A. altissima. These results give an estimate of the threat to biodiversity ascribed to A. altissima in the Fontainebleau forest. (C) 2011 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Post-clearing recovery of coastal dunes invaded by Acacia longifolia: is duration of invasion relevant for management success?
AU  - Marchante, Helia
AU  - Freitas, Helena
AU  - Hoffmann, John H.
T2  - Journal of Applied Ecology
AB  - 1. Invasive plants destroy the structure and function of many ecosystems but removal is expensive, so the likelihood of success should be assessed before a major control programme commences. Trial clearings can clarify how best to design and perform broad-scale clearing programmes. Such trials need to consider the range of conditions that might affect the outcome of control operations, not least the duration of invasion before clearing commences, a parameter that has rarely been considered previously. 2. The recovery of plant communities was monitored over 6 years in a Portuguese coastal dune system after the removal of invasive Acacia longifolia plants, together with the underlying litter in half of the cleared areas but not in the remainder. Areas that had been invaded for > 20 years (long-invaded) as opposed to < 7 years (recently invaded) were compared. 3. After the removal of A. longifolia, recently invaded areas had more exotic plant species but also higher native species richness, plant cover, initial diversity and species turnover rates than long-invaded areas. Generalist native species were initially very abundant in cleared areas but progressively gave way to species more typical of dunes. Six years after clearing, many species that usually occur on dunes were still missing. Therophytes were the most abundant life form immediately after clearing, but nanophanerophytes, chamaephytes and A. longifolia increased with time. Seedlings of A. longifolia were most abundant in long-invaded areas, but litter removal along with plants promoted increased plant species richness and cover and decreased susceptibility to reinvasion. 4. Synthesis and applications. A number of variables can affect the outcome of clearing invasive plant species. For A. longifolia on Portuguese dunes, recently invaded areas should be prioritized and thick litter layers should be removed along with the invader. Even so, recovery of native flora was not complete in this study, and other management actions are needed to supplement clearing operations, for example propagation of native species or prescribed fires to deplete the invasive species seed bank. Although complete restoration of the ecosystem will almost always be impossible, it should be possible in the long term to create an ecosystem with a structure and function that resembles the original habitat.

AB  - The annual dynamics of the number and taxonomic composition of yeast communities were studied in the phyllosphere, on the flowers, and on the roots of Indian balsam (Impatiens glandulifera Royle) and in the mucky gley soil under the thickets of this plant. It was shown that typical phyllosphere yeast communities with a predominance of the red-pigmented species Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Rhodotorula glutinis and the typical epiphyte Cryptococcus magnus are formed on the leaves of this annual hygrophyte. However, yeast groups with a predominance of the ascosporous species Saccharomyces paradoxus, Kazachstania barnet-tii, and Torulaspora delbrueckii, which are not typical of soils at all, were found in the mucky gley soil under the thickets of Indian balsam. Thus, the epiphytic and soil yeast complexes under the thickets of Indian balsam are represented by two entirely discrete communities without common species. In other biogeocenoses of the forest zone, the rearrangement of the structure of yeast communities in passing from the aboveground substrates to the soil proceeds gradually, and most of the species can be isolated both from the aboveground parts of plants and from the soil. The strong difference between the yeast communities in the phyllosphere of Indian balsam and in the soil under its thickets is apparently related to the fact that the annual hygrophytes are decomposed very quickly (during several days after the first frosts). Because of this, an intermediate layer between the phyllosphere and the soil (the litter layer), in which epiphytic microorganisms can develop, is not formed under these plants.

T2  - Revue D Ecologie-La Terre Et La Vie
AB  - In this paper we present the woodland dynamics of the Moselle valley, upstream from Nancy in north-eastern France. The Moselle flow regime has been partly preserved, although the valley underwent extensive land-uses in the past, with two periods of abandonment of agriculture practices since the 1870s. In the 2377 hectares of the Natura 2000 zone, the surface areas of all woodland patches of more than 0.1 ha were quantified by GIS (Arcview 3.3R), on the scale of 1:50.000 from aerial photographs from 1950 and 2003. One hundred and thirty-six phytosociological surveys were performed on vascular plants, and abundance dominance was estimated by eye using the phytosociological scale. Human impact (cuttings, plantations, presence of ancient orchards) was evaluated by field trip. Woodlands were separated into two categories of conservation: high (i.e. natural character of forest architecture) and low (with human impacts). From these data, we quantified the surface areas of each forest community defined by phytosociology, as well as their conservation value. Fallopia x bohemica Chrtek & Chrtkova and Impatiens glandulifera Royle were tested with regard to the following factors: forest type, shape (perimeter), size (surface area), and age (more or less than 50 years old), and the frequency of flooding. Data were analysed using the Kruskall-Wallis test. The total forest surface was 546.6 ha, split into 397 patches of various areas (ranging from 0.1 to 16.6 ha). On the current wooded forest surface, 11.1% was less than 50 years old. Four forest types were identified: willow bush (Salicetum triandrae) and willow tree (Salicetum albae) forest communities, both on river banks close to the river; ash-alder (Pruno-Fraxinetum) on more elevated sites; and marsh alder (Alnetum glutinosae) in old channels. The total species richness was 126. Ash-alder patches were the richest in species, and the most complex in architecture when not influenced by human activities. Communities of high conservation value were found in all forest types but in lower proportion than those of lower conservation value (28.4 versus 71.6%, respectively). Compared with other floodplain forests of similar ecology in the Rhine plain, the woodlands of the upper Moselle valley were more fragmented, but more natural because of the lack of recent silvicultural activities. Their relative youth explains why they lack native species of trees and some geophytes that are typical of mid- or late successional stages. Willow forests showed greater invasion by exotic species, and younger forests were invaded to a greater extent than forests over 50 years old by Fallopia x bohemica Chrtek & Khrtkova and Impatiens glandulifera Royle. The increase of woodlands in willow stands can be considered as a sign of modestly successful recovery from long-term deforestation. Of course, these fallows will never return to pristine old-growth forests. They could be defined as "feral" or "dedomesticated" landscapes because succession processes will take different courses and different lengths of time compared with natural processes. Such "dedomesticated" landscapes would however provide interesting evolutionary perspectives for the long term and suggest the interest of research in the context of changing uses. Forests should be therefore allowed to continue their expansion so that the entire range of natural habitats, as well as novel habitats, are re-created and full functional links can be established between terrestrial and aquatic communities.

T2  - International Journal of Plant Sciences
AB  - Two alien Impatiens species are spreading in Europe and share habitats with the native Impatiens noli-tangere. We studied their reproductive biology to estimate which traits facilitate invasiveness. Flower morphology was examined, insect observations were made, and hand pollination treatments were performed. Floral biology differed among species. Impatiens glandulifera and I. noli-tangere presented large quantities of sucrose-dominant nectar, contrary to Impatiens parviflora. The latter had high autonomous selfing ability (81.4% fruit set) linked to complete self-compatibility. No inbreeding depression was detected for this species. The second alien, I. glandulifera, showed lower autonomous selfing (9.3% fruit set), with high self-compatibility and low inbreeding depression (delta = 0.11). No evidence of autonomous selfing was found for the native, which presented the lowest self-compatibility and the highest inbreeding depression (delta = 0.42). However, all species can be considered self-compatible. Impatiens glandulifera flowers were visited by insects up to 250 times during their life span, whereas I. noli-tangere and I. parviflora flowers received fewer than seven visits. Both exotics present traits facilitating reproductive success. Impatiens parviflora exhibits autonomous self-pollination, whereas the other species possess attractive traits with respect to insect pollination. On the other hand, the native, unable to self-pollinate, is poorly attractive to pollinators. The high fecundity of the aliens seems to contribute to their invasiveness.

T2  - Plant Ecology & Diversity
AB  - Background: In temperate mountains, most non-native plant species reach their distributional limit somewhere along the elevational gradient. However, it is unclear if growth limitations can explain upper range limits and whether phenotypic plasticity or genetic changes allow species to occupy a broad elevational gradient. Aims: We investigated how non-native plant individuals from different elevations responded to growing season temperatures, which represented conditions at the core and margin of the elevational distributions of the species. Methods: We recorded the occurrence of nine non-native species in the Swiss Alps and subsequently conducted a climate chamber experiment to assess growth rates of plants from different elevations under different temperature treatments. Results: The elevational limit observed in the field was not related to the species' temperature response in the climate chamber experiment. Almost all species showed a similar level of reduction in growth rates under lower temperatures independent of the upper elevational limit of the species' distribution. For two species we found indications for genetic differentiation among plants from different elevations. Conclusions: We conclude that factors other than growing season temperatures, such as extreme events or winter mortality, might shape the elevational limit of non-native species, and that ecological filtering might select for genotypes that are phenotypically plastic.

AB  - In some Asian countries, the seeds of Himalayan balsam or policeman's helmet, Impatiens glandulifera Royle are harvested as a food source. First introduced to Europe in 1838-1839, I. glandulifera quickly became a garden favourite and later on a prodigious weed. Nowadays I. glandulifera is highly invasive in almost whole Europe and occurs in various habitats. So far, little has been known about the genetic diversity of I. glandulifera in the Baltic region. The objective of this study was to evaluate the genetic variability of Lithuanian populations of I. glandulifera differing in geography or habitats by the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), using 8 primers. At the species level, all DNA bands (188) were polymorphic. Among populations of I. glandulifera genetic parameters ranged in the following intervals: 40-56% of polymorphic DNA bands, 0.115-0.165 for Nei's gene diversity, 0.179-0.255 for Shannon's information index. Pairwise genetic distances between populations ranged in the interval 0.088-0.259. AMOVA showed significant genetic differentiation off glandulifera populations in Lithuania (Phi(PT) = 0.511, p <= 0.01). Percentage of polymorphic DNA bands (generated by RAPD primers) of the populations correlated negatively with the site's mean temperature for vegetation season (r = -0.535, p < 0.015). Only for one population (Palanga population located near the Baltic sea) out of 20, significant relations were found between this population genetic and geographic distances to the other populations (r= -0.755, p < 0.001). Genetic distance-based cluster analyses for 400 individuals indicated 4 major groups of populations, among which there was no clear geographical pattern. Our RAPD analyses indicate multiple introduction of this species in Lithuania. Presumably several different ways of invasion of I. glandulifera took place: natural run and predisposing it intentional and unintentional dispersal by human.

AB  - The effect of Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera) on survival and growth of naturally regenerated silver birch (Betula pendula) and planted Norway spruce (Picea abies) and silver fir (Abies alba) seedlings was studied in a weeding experiment over 3 years. Three different treatments were applied: control, mowing, and hand weeding by pulling out the entire plant. There were no consistent treatment effects on height and diameter of the tree seedlings. The coverage of Rubus fruticosus had a negative impact on diameter increment of Norway spruce and silver fir. As opposed to growth, treatment effects on seedling survival could be found for planted Norway spruce and silver fir. However, it is very likely that these effects, namely higher seedling survival after mowing, have to be attributed to the control of bramble (Rubus fruticosus) rather than to that of Himalayan balsam. It is concluded that Himalayan balsam is not able to seriously affect the growth of already established seedlings.

AB  - P>Exotic plant invasions can alter ecosystem processes, particularly if the invasive species are functionally different from native species. We investigated whether such alterations can be explained by differences in functional traits between native and invasive plants of the same functional group or by differences in functional group affiliation. We compared six invasive forbs in Europe with six native forbs and six native graminoids in leaf and whole-plant traits, plasticity in response to nutrient supply and interspecific competition, litter decomposition rate, effects on soil nutrient availability, and allelopathy. All traits were measured in a series of pot experiments, and leaf traits additionally in the field. Invasive forbs differed from native forbs for only a few traits; they had less leaf chlorophyll and lower phosphorus (P) uptake from soil, but they tended to have a stronger allelopathic effect. The invasive forbs differed in many traits from the native graminoids, their leaves had lower tissue densities and a shorter life span, their litter decomposed faster and they had a lower nitrogen-use efficiency. Our results suggest that invasive forbs have the potential to alter ecosystem properties when invading graminoid-dominated and displacing native graminoids but not when displacing native forbs.

T2  - Perspectives in Plant Ecology Evolution and Systematics
AB  - Invasion of some alien plants is considered to be associated with inter-population differentiation and adaptations to local conditions. To obtain an insight into these processes it is convenient to compare invasive plants with their native congeners. The intra-specific differentiation during invasion was studied using four Impatiens (Balsaminaceae) species in Central Europe: native Impatiens noli-tangere and three aliens (highly invasive Impatiens glandulifera, less invasive Impatiens parviflora and potentially invasive Impatiens capensis). Differentiation in traits important for the establishment (germination; seedling emergence; seedling frost resistance) was measured in a laboratory and an experimental garden using seed collected from five natural populations of each species. Frost resistance oil. capensis, currently invasive in Western Europe, was within the scope of other congeners and it does not seem to be a barrier to spread of the species into Central Europe. Among-population differences were found within all species except I. capensis. In I. noli-tangere, I. glandulifera and I. parvillora the differences were related to the climatic characteristics in early spring at the source localities, which indicates that individuals may be adapted to local conditions. The differences found between the populations of I. noli-tangere, I. glandulifera and I. parviflora are likely to reflect the frost sensitivity of the species. In the highly frost-sensitive I. parviflora differentiation was found both in germination and frost resistance of individual populations. In I. glandulifera the differences among populations in frost sensitivity depended on temperature at the seed source and corresponded to the pattern of emergence of seedlings in the garden. In the native I. non-tangere, the differences among populations in the time of germination depended on temperature at the seed-source locality. Since local adaptations were indicated both in native and invasive species studied, they are unlikely to provide the invasive Impatiens species with an advantage against the native congener. at least in terms of the traits investigated.

T2  - Plant Biosystems
AB  - In this work the occurrence of non-native species was recorded along the elevation gradient in the Alps, in order to establish their distribution pattern, their current altitudinal limits and to elucidate which species are presumably adapted to higher elevations. Plots were located along the course of rivers in five valleys from 100 to 2100m a.s.l. Sixty-eight non-natives were recorded in the study area. The proportion of invasives was found to be much higher in the study area then in the whole administrative region. The number of non-natives per plot decreased strongly with increasing elevation. The great majority (94%) of the non-native species grows at the lowest elevations, while only 6% survive up to 1500m and none was found above this limit. Results were interpreted considering the factors driving the invasion process (disturbance, the native communities' resistance to invasion, propagule pressure, climatic conditions) and plant traits with particular respect to pre-adaptation to the harsh climate, which increases progressively with elevation. Results confirm that the Alps are not immune from invasion, at least up to medium elevation.

AB  - Background: Nitrogen fixation has been quantified for a range of crop legumes and actinorhizal plants under different agricultural/agroforestry conditions, but much less is known of legume and actinorhizal plant N-2 fixation in natural ecosystems. Aims: To assess the proportion of total plant N derived from the atmosphere via the process of N-2 fixation (% Ndfa) by actinorhizal and legume plants in natural ecosystems and their N input into these ecosystems as indicated by their N-15 natural abundance. Methods: A comprehensive collation of published values of % Ndfa for legumes and actinorhizal plants in natural ecosystems and their N input into these ecosystems as estimated by their N-15 natural abundance was carried out by searching the ISI Web of Science database using relevant key words. Results: The % Ndfa was consistently large for actinorhizal plants but very variable for legumes in natural ecosystems, and the average value for % Ndfa was substantially greater for actinorhizal plants. High soil N, in particular, but also low soil P and water content were correlated with low legume N-2 fixation. N input into ecosystems from N-2 fixation was very variable for actinorhizal and legume plants and greatly dependent on their biomass within the system. Conclusions: Measurement of N-15 natural abundance has given greater understanding of where legume and actinorhizal plant N-2 fixation is important in natural ecosystems. Across studies, the average value for % Ndfa was substantially greater for actinorhizal plants than for legumes, and the relative abilities of the two groups of plants to utilise mineral N requires further study.

AB  - Global change may substantially affect biodiversity and ecosystem functioning but little is known about its effects on essential biotic interactions. Since different environmental drivers rarely act in isolation it is important to consider interactive effects. Here, we focus on how two key drivers of anthropogenic environmental change, climate change and the introduction of alien species, affect plant-pollinator interactions. Based on a literature survey we identify climatically sensitive aspects of species interactions, assess potential effects of climate change on these mechanisms, and derive hypotheses that may form the basis of future research. We find that both climate change and alien species will ultimately lead to the creation of novel communities. In these communities certain interactions may no longer occur while there will also be potential for the emergence of new relationships. Alien species can both partly compensate for the often negative effects of climate change but also amplify them in some cases. Since potential positive effects are often restricted to generalist interactions among species, climate change and alien species in combination can result in significant threats to more specialist interactions involving native species.

T2  - Ecography
AB  - The altitudinal distribution of plants is restricted by various environmental factors, with climatic conditions being one of the primary constraints. Here, we investigate what limits the altitudinal range of the introduced species Erigeron annuus in the Swiss Alps. We planted offspring of E. annuus plants originating from different altitudes into two common gardens, one located at an altitude representing the main area of distribution (400 m) and the other close to the current altitudinal limit of E. annuus in Switzerland (1000 m). In both common gardens all established plants survived and grew vigorously during the growing season. However, there was high winter mortality of seedlings at 1000 m. Furthermore, plant phenology was delayed and reproductive output was reduced at 1000 m, although the seeds produced were larger. The general lack of adaptation to altitude and only moderate levels of plasticity suggest that there is little potential for E. annuus to persist beyond its current altitudinal limit in the Swiss Alps. However, climate warming might promote the upward range expansion of E. annuus by reducing winter mortality and by increasing the chance of producing seeds within the growing season.

AB  - Although they are typically assumed to be negative, the consequences of plant invasions for native diversity or biological integrity are seldom broadly quantified (i.e., for multiple taxa or across large regions). We investigated the impacts associated with invasion of wetlands by reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.; RCG) on plants and several animal groups. In a local study, we compared plants, arthropods, and small mammals on treatment plots with reduced RCG dominance to those on highly invaded plots. We also conducted a companion study, where we measured RCG dominance and plants, arthropods, and birds in 82 randomly selected wetlands across Illinois (USA) to determine if our experimental results were consistent in communities across the region. Plant diversity, floristic quality, and diversity and abundance of Homopteran insects decreased with RCG dominance in all instances. Richness and abundance of all other arthropods decreased with increasing RCG in the local study, but no trend was detected in communities statewide. No relationship between total abundance or richness of small mammals (local) or birds (statewide) with RCG was detected. However, voles and shrews were more abundant, and mice less abundant, in RCG-dominated plots. These results support the hypothesis that there are negative effects for multiple taxa from RCG invasion. Because negative effects observed in the local study either corroborated, or were neutral with respect to results from statewide surveys, they suggest that native biodiversity and biological integrity are being dampened across wide areas of this invader's range.

TI  - Invasibility or invasiveness? Effects of habitat, genotype, and their interaction on invasive Rhododendron ponticum populations
AU  - Erfmeier, Alexandra

T2  - Biological Invasions
AB  - The extent and nature of biological invasions are mainly influenced by either the genotype of the invading species, the suitability of the new habitat or by genotype-habitat interactions expressed in adaptations to the new environment. The relevance of these factors was assessed for the invasive evergreen shrub Rhododendron ponticum. Habitat characteristics of soil, climate and community properties were analysed in six native populations in both Georgia (Caucasus) and Spain and in six invasive ones in Ireland. Growth variables of rhododendron individuals and seedling occurrences in the field served as response variables. We performed a reciprocal transplant experiment with rhododendron cuttings and determined survival of transplants in all countries. Due to low survival rates in Georgia and Spain, vegetative increase was only analysed for Ireland. The Irish sites benefited from significantly higher nutrient supply than the Spanish and Georgian sites. We found both strong positive correlations of nutrient supply and negative correlations of seasonal temperature amplitude with growth variables of shoots and seedling density. Origin, target site and interaction effects were significant in the survival of transplanted rhododendron individuals. The Irish site was more favorable for all genotypes, but the invasive genotypes did not perform better than the native ones. The total increase in shoot length of transplants in Ireland was highest in the Irish genotypes, which might suggest adaptation of the Irish populations to their new area. In conclusion, we found evidence for invasiveness of Irish Rhododendron ponticum populations, but only in the invaded habitat. Nonetheless, habitats in the new range also seem to be well suited to native Spanish populations, supporting the idea that invasibility of these new sites also contributes to rhododendron invasion success.

T2  - Journal of Ecology
AB  - 1. Habitat loss, land use intensification and biological invasions are all threatening pollinator communities, but the combined effects of these factors on pollinator diversity and pollination services have not been studied yet. 2. Here, we tested the hypotheses that (i) the invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera outcompetes native plant communities for pollinators, and (ii) pollinator abundances depend on landscape structure, but are modulated by this mass-flowering invader. 3. We selected 14 study sites in riparian habitats along a landscape gradient with decreasing proportion of natural land cover. Within each site paired invaded or non-invaded plots were studied. We performed standardized surveys of pollinators and established experimental plots by adding the native plant Raphanus sativus to assess the impact of I. glandulifera on visitation rates and seed set. 4. Impatiens glandulifera was well integrated in the plant-pollinator network, being visited by several native pollinators, mainly bumblebees. The invader received higher visitation rates than simultaneously flowering native riparian plants and the experimentally added native R. sativus. However, visitation rates to the native plant community showed no significant differences between invaded and non-invaded plots, with the exception of honeybees, which slightly increased their visits in invaded plots. With regard to the experimental setting, the presence of I. glandulifera reduced bumblebee visitation to R. sativus pots, but had no significant effects on seed set. 5. We found enhanced visitation rates of bumblebees in intensively used agricultural landscapes. However, in the presence of I. glandulifera this landscape effect was masked by bumblebees being highly attracted to I. glandulifera stands independent of the structure of the surrounding landscape. Surprisingly, wild bees and hoverflies were not affected by landscape structure, but, as also the case with bumblebees, they were principally affected by the immediate community flower abundance. 6. Synthesis. Our data provide no evidence that I. glandulifera outcompetes native plants for pollinators. However, social bees were very attracted to this late-seasonal floral resource. We conclude that both, plant invasions and landscape structure have important effects on the plant-pollinator community studied, but that they operate at different stages of the flowering season.

AB  - Comparative studies of closely related species may provide useful insights into the effect of species traits on invasion success since some of the biases associated with multispecies studies, such as phylogenetic effects, are considerably reduced by virtue of the experimental design. In this study seed and seedling traits of three congeneric alien species in Europe, differing in their region of origin, invasion status and history (Impatiens glandulifera, I. parviflora, L capensis), were compared with the native L noli-tangere in laboratory and common garden experiments. Seeds of I. glandulifera required the shortest period of stratification, germinated well both under laboratory and experimental garden conditions and the seedlings produced more biomass than those of the other species. Seeds of I. parviflora required a longer period of stratification, had the highest percentage germination but seedling emergence in the experimental garden was poorer than in L glandulifera. Neither of these two species invasive in the Czech Republic formed soil seed banks. The native I. noli-tangere had the lowest percentage germination and formed a short-term persistent seed bank. Impatiens capensis germinated well in the laboratory, had the highest seedling emergence in the garden and its seed remained viable in the soil for three years. This indicates that in terms of germination and emergence, this species is comparable with the two invasive alien congeners and there appear to be no constraints to its invasion in the Czech Republic where it does not occur yet. Its absence may be due to a low propagule pressure; in the national flora L capensis is listed as a potential future invader without mentioning it being cultivated in this country. Our results indicate that differences in the invasiveness of three alien species of balsams in the temperate zone of Central Europe can be attributed, at least in part, to their differing performances in the early stages of their life cycle. The short period of time required for seed stratification and the high seedling biomass of L glandulifera might have increased its invasion potential compared to other Impatiens species occurring in the Czech Republic.

AB  - The structure of plant-pollinator networks has been claimed to be resilient to changes in species composition due to the weak degree of dependence among mutualistic partners. However, detailed empirical investigations of the consequences of introducing an alien plant species into mutualistic networks are lacking. We present the first cross-European analysis by using a standardized protocol to assess the degree to which a particular alien plant species (i.e. Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis, Impatiens glandulifera, Opuntia stricta, Rhododendron ponticum and Solanum elaeagnifolium) becomes integrated into existing native plant-pollinator networks, and how this translates to changes in network structure. Alien species were visited by almost half of the pollinator species present, accounting on average for 42 per cent of the visits and 24 per cent of the network interactions. Furthermore, in general, pollinators depended upon alien plants more than on native plants. However, despite the fact that invaded communities received more visits than uninvaded communities, the dominant role of alien species over natives did not translate into overall changes in network connectance, plant linkage level and nestedness. Our results imply that although supergeneralist alien plants can play a central role in the networks, the structure of the networks appears to be very permeable and robust to the introduction of invasive alien species into the network.

AB  - Arion lusitanicus Mabille (= A. vulgaris Moquin-Tandon) causes significant crop damage in some parts of Poland. In the course of research into alternative methods of limiting the damage caused by A. lusitanicus to crop plants, no-choice tests were carried out on the palatability and consumption of 95 species of herbaceous plants and oilseed rape. In controlled laboratory conditions, over six consecutive days, the damage to the plants caused by the slug was observed (in the 2-3 leaf phase). For each tested plant species, a palatability index (P.I.) and a consumption index (C.I.) Were determined. As a result of the observations the slugs' feeding behaviour was described, palatable and unpalatable plants were distinguished, and the degree of acceptance of those plants by the slug Was determined. A. lusitanicus showed differentiated preferences in, respect of various plant species. Approximately 23%, were unpalatable plants, and 48%, low-palatability plants. Unpalatable plants included such species as Impatiens roylei, Geranium robertianum, Saponaria officinalis, Glechoma hederacea, Epilobium palustre and Geum urbanum. 26% of the tested species are palatable to the slug. These include Artemisia dracunculus, Tripleurospermum inodorum, Datura stramonium, Lamium amplexicaule, Myosotis arvensis, Satureja hortensis and Conium maculatum. The remaining two species (Ocimum basilicum, Trifolium repens) have palatability equal to that of the control plant Brassica napus. It Was noticed that the level of acceptance of particular plant species by A. lusitanicus was not affected by the plants' life cycle and their family membership. It Was found that there was highly significant differentiation in slugs' feeding behaviour depending on the plant species.

AB  - We assess the population genetic structure of the invasive riparian weed Impatiens glandulifera, and where possible, determine whether natural or anthropogenic dispersal best explains the observed patterns. Results are compared with a similar contemporary analysis for Heracleum mantegazzianum undertaken in the same catchments, and we suggest that some of the observed differences in genetic structure could be because of life history differences between these species. Our results confirm the importance of at least occasional dispersal events mediated by human activity in the colonisation and subsequent spread of invasive plants in river catchments. However, processes related to river structure, dispersal range and genetic drift also appear to be structuring these populations over short temporal scales. The implication is that local populations can be established as small founders, and therefore eradication programs need to be thorough and undertaken at the catchment scale. Effective management needs to consider the natural spread of riparian species along rivers, but also prevent long-distance dispersal from sources outside the catchment.

AB  - Although the alien Impatiens glandulifera successfully invades riparian habitats and is visited by native insects, knowledge of its impact on native bees is limited. We assessed pollinator abundance in field sites where I. glandulifera was absent, present or had been experimentally removed. We measured insect visitation to flowers of potted native plants and to I. glandulifera. Bombus spp. comprised the highest proportion of visitors in invaded sites, whereas solitary bees made up the highest proportion in sites where I. glandulifera was removed. More bees, especially medium- and long-tongued Bombus spp. ( B. pascuorum and B. hortorum), foraged on I. glandulifera than the native plant species ( possibly because the alien was more abundant). We detected no impact of invasion on standardised pollinator abundance, B. pascuorum abundance, nor functional insect diversity, which may be due to variable climatic conditions. We suggest that future studies focus on impacts on rare or specialised pollinator taxa.

T2  - Journal of Ecology
AB  - Much attention has been paid to negative effects of alien species on resident communities but studies that quantify community-level effects of a number of invasive plants are scarce. We address this issue by assessing the impact of 13 species invasive in the Czech Republic on a wide range of plant communities. Vegetation in invaded and uninvaded plots with similar site conditions was sampled. All species of vascular plants were recorded, their covers were estimated and used as importance values for calculating the Shannon diversity index H', evenness J and Sorensen index of similarity between invaded and uninvaded vegetation. With the exception of two invasive species, species richness, diversity and evenness were reduced in invaded plots. Species exhibiting the greatest impact reduced species numbers per plot and the total number of species recorded in the communities sampled by almost 90%. A strong reduction of species number at the plot scale resulted in a marked reduction in the total species number at the landscape scale, and in less similarity between invaded and uninvaded vegetation. The decrease in species richness in invaded compared to uninvaded plots is largely driven by the identity of the invading species, whereas the major determinants of the decrease in Shannon diversity and evenness are the cover and height of invading species, and differences between height and cover of invading and dominant native species, independent of species identity. Synthesis. Management decisions based on impact need to distinguish between invasive species, as their effects on diversity and composition of resident vegetation differ largely. Tall invading species capable of forming populations with the cover markedly greater than that of native dominant species exert the most severe effects on species diversity and evenness. Since a strong impact on the community scale is associated with reduction in species diversity at higher scales, invaders with a high impact represent a serious hazard to the landscape.

T2  - Biological Invasions
AB  - Results from experiments studying different factors determining invasibility (e.g. land use, disturbance, biotic interactions) at different spatial scales are mainly used in isolation, probably because a methodology for integration is lacking. Recent studies show that factors affecting invasibility most likely do so in a hierarchical manner, with different factors acting more strongly at different spatial scales. Climate can be considered the dominant factor at the continental scale, while at regional and landscape scale topography, land cover and land use become increasingly important. At smaller spatial scales, soil type, disturbance, biotic interactions, resources, and microclimate may become significant. In the current paper, we propose a hierarchical framework for combining results from different types of studies. In this hierarchical system, factors operating at a smaller scale are subordinate to factors operating at a larger scale, but if conditions at higher levels are satisfied, the small-scale factors may become indispensable for making accurate predictions. Depending on the aim of the study, the accuracy of prediction can be selected by the researcher, which in its turn determines which data are required. We discuss several applications of the framework and indicate some options for future research. Although the complexity of natural systems presents fundamental limits to predictions, we think this framework can provide a useful tool for the identification of areas of risk for biological invasions, for improving our understanding of invasibility, and for identifying gaps in our current knowledge.

AB  - We investigated the correlated response of several key traits of Lythrum salicaria L. to water availability gradients in introduced (Iowa, USA) and native (Switzerland, Europe) populations. This was done to investigate whether plants exhibit a shift in life-history strategy during expansion into more stressful habitats during the secondary phase of invasion, as has recently been hypothesized by Dietz and Edwards (Ecology 87(6):1359, 2006). Plants in invaded habitats exhibited a correlated increase in longevity and decrease in overall size in the transition into more stressful mesic habitats. In contrast, plants in the native range only exhibited a decrease in height. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that secondary invasion is taking place in L. salicaria, allowing it to be more successful under the more stressful mesic conditions in the invaded range. If this trend continues, L. salicaria may become a more problematic species in the future.

T2  - Ecology
AB  - Due to altered ecological and evolutionary contexts, we might expect the responses of alien plants to environmental gradients, as revealed through patterns of trait variation, to differ from those of the same species in their native range. In particular, the spread of alien plant species along such gradients might be limited by their ability to establish clinal patterns of trait variation. We investigated trends in growth and reproductive traits in natural populations of eight invasive Asteraceae forbs along altitudinal gradients in their native and introduced ranges (Valais, Switzerland, and Wallowa Mountains, Oregon, USA). Plants showed similar responses to altitude in both ranges, being generally smaller and having fewer inflorescences but larger seeds at higher altitudes. However, these trends were modified by region-specific effects that were independent of species status ( native or introduced), suggesting that any differential performance of alien species in the introduced range cannot be interpreted without a fully reciprocal approach to test the basis of these differences. Furthermore, we found differences in patterns of resource allocation to capitula among species in the native and the introduced areas. These suggest that the mechanisms underlying trait variation, for example, increasing seed size with altitude, might differ between ranges. The rapid establishment of clinal patterns of trait variation in the new range indicates that the need to respond to altitudinal gradients, possibly by local adaptation, has not limited the ability of these species to invade mountain regions. Studies are now needed to test the underlying mechanisms of altitudinal clines in traits of alien species.

AB  - Exotic invasive plant species differ in their effects oil indigenous vegetation its evidenced by research evaluating community response to their removal. We used a removal approach to quantify file response of a mesic woodland to the removal versus retention of an invasive plant, Hesperis matronalis (dame's rocket) from paired treatment plots over 3 y. Cover of H. matronalis did not differ between control and treatment plots prior to removal, declined in the removal plots and remained significantly lower in cover compared to file control plots. Removal did not significantly affect species richness and species diversify (evenness, Shannon and Simpson) at the plot scale, but did result in increased Species richness overall in the removal plots in the last sampling year when compared to control plots. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination analysis indicated a significant compositional change in the spring plant composition of plots over the 3 y, reflecting an increase in exotic woody species. Exotic Woolly plants, especially Rosa multiflora and Euonymus alatus, increased in cover in response to H matronalis removal. In the 3 y, neither native nor exotic forbs, nor native woody plains responded to the removal of H. matronalis in a statistically significant manner. The increasing cover of woody invasive plants in response to the removal of II. matronalis has important management implications for restoration of degraded communities.

AB  - Impatiens glandulifera (Balsaminaceae) is one of the most widely distributed invasive alien plants in Europe. In the Czech Republic, it first colonized open riverbank habitats and more recently less humid and more shaded habitats where it comes in contact with two congeners, the native I. noli-tangere and earlier invader I. parviflora; both these species are likely to be affected by competition with I glandulifera. A reciprocal sowing experiment was established to explore the performance and possible microsite differentiation of the three Impatiens species in the field. Three triads of plots, each dominated by one Impatiens species, were established in surroundings of a river with a fine-grained mosaic of woody and meadow vegetation in southern Bohemia, Czech Republic. The plots were protected from the natural input of seed by cutting the vegetation 20 cm above the soil surface and covering the surface with a cloth during the period of seed release. Each plot consisted of a subplot sown with a mixture of seed of all three species collected at the same locality and a control subplot with no seed added. Sites dominated by I. noli-tangere and I. parviflora were suitable for germination of all Impatiens species; the I. parviflora sites were more suitable for the establishment and further development of Impatiens plants. This indicates that I. noli-tangere was outcompeted from sites currently dominated by I. parviflora and further spread of I. glandulifera into sites occupied by the other Impatiens species is likely. Experimental plots in sites dominated by I. glandulifera were unsuitable for growth of all species, including its own seedlings.

AB  - Background: Non-native invasive plants capable of fast growth may establish and develop rapidly under the high soil nitrogen (N) and increased irradiance levels that occur in gaps at disturbed sites within deciduous woodland. However, if disturbance is transitory, then the long-term success of an invasive species within deciduous woodland will be dependent on its ability to compete with native species and acclimate to the typical conditions of low N availability and irradiance. Aims: To gain greater understanding of the ecophysiological reasons for the success of Impatiens glandulifera as a weed species in deciduous woodland. Methods: We examined N form, N concentration and irradiance effects on seed dormancy, N nutrition and shade acclimation of Impatiens. Results: Under controlled conditions, Impatiens seed required a period of wet chilling to overcome dormancy. High nitrate (NO(3)(-)) concentration and light gave substantial increases in germination over 8-12 weeks chilling and decreased time to 50% emergence over a full winter's chilling. Under high irradiance in a glasshouse, Impatiens showed N nutrition characteristics similar to those of fast growing crop and weed species. Within woodland and on high and relatively low NO(3)(-) supply in a glasshouse, Impatiens showed a range of mechanisms of acclimation to low irradiance, in particular, increases in height, dry matter partitioning to the shoot, use of NO(3)(-) as osmoticum in stems, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf chlorophyll concentration. Conclusions: High soil NO(3)(-) concentrations and light may be factors in the synchronisation of emergence of Impatiens in disturbed sites producing a high-density and competitively strong cohort of seedlings within a short period of time. Rapid growth under high irradiance and N supply will allow Impatiens seedlings to establish quickly in disturbed woodland sites. Acclimation to low irradiance, in particular, maintenance of height and development of an exceptionally high SLA at relatively low NO(3)(-) supply, as demonstrated could allow Impatiens to shade out competing field layer species at the low levels of N and irradiance typical of woodland.

AB  - Rapid evolutionary adjustments to novel environments may contribute to the successful spread of invasive species, and can lead to niche shifts making range dynamics unpredictable. These effects might be intensified by artificial selection in the course of breeding efforts, since many successful plant invaders were deliberately introduced and cultivated as ornamentals. We hypothesized that the invasion success of Buddleja davidii, the ornamental butterfly bush, is facilitated by local adaptation to minimum temperatures and thus, exhibits unpredictable range dynamics. To assess the potential effects of adaptive evolution and artificial selection on the spread of B. davidii, we combined a common garden experiment investigating local adaptation to frost, with ecological niche modelling of the species' native and invasive ranges. We expected that populations naturalized in sub-continental climate are less susceptible to frost than populations from oceanic climate, and that the invasive range does not match predictions based on climatic data from the native range. Indeed, we revealed significant variation among invasive B. davidii populations in frost resistance. However, frost hardiness was not related to geographic location or climatic variables of the populations' home site, suggesting that invasive B. davidii populations are not locally adapted to minimum temperatures. This is in line with results of our ecological niche model that did not detect a niche shift between the species' native range in China, and its invasive range in Europe and North America. Furthermore, our niche model showed that the potential invasive range of B. davidii is still not completely occupied. Together with the frost resistance data obtained in our experiment, the results indicate that climatic conditions are currently not limiting the further spread of the species in Europe and North America.

T2  - Invasive Plant Science and Management
AB  - Field and garden experiments were performed to investigate if pathogens, generalist herbivores, or a specialist herbivore (the tortricid moth Pristerognatha fuligana) have the potential to control the invasive Himalayan balsam. Impacts of generalist herbivores and pathogenic fungi were excluded by using thiacloprid and trifloxystrobin. Results show no effect of any antagonist in the field experiment, though we found a modest impact of the combined influence of generalist herbivores and pathogenic fungi in the garden experiment, i.e., under suboptimal growing conditions. Limited information from the native area (the Himalayas) suggests a strong impact of specialist herbivores, thus confirming the enemy release hypothesis. We predict that impact studies of native specialized herbivores will clearly indicate antagonists from the native area with a strong impact on Himalayan balsam in its invaded area.

AB  - Alien invasive plants are capable of modifying ecosystem function. However, it is difficult to make generalisations because impacts often appear to be species- and site-specific. In this study, we examined the impacts of seven highly invasive plant species in NW Europe (Fallopia japonica, Heracleum mantegazzianum, Impatiens glandulifera, Prunus serotina, Rosa rugosa, Senecio inaequidens, Solidago gigantea) on nutrient pools in the topsoil and the standing biomass. We tested if the impacts follow predictable patterns, across species and sites or, alternatively, if they are entirely idiosyncratic. To that end, we compared invaded and adjacent uninvaded plots in a total of 36 sites with widely divergent soil chemistry and vegetation composition. For all species, invaded plots had increased aboveground biomass and nutrient stocks in standing biomass compared to uninvaded vegetation. This suggests that enhanced nutrient uptake may be a key trait of highly invasive plant species. The magnitude and direction of the impact on topsoil chemical properties were strongly site-specific. A striking finding is that the direction of change in soil properties followed a predictable pattern. Thus, strong positive impacts (higher topsoil nutrient concentrations in invaded plots compared to uninvaded ones) were most often found in sites with initially low nutrient concentrations in the topsoil, while negative impacts were generally found under the opposite conditions. This pattern was significant for potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese and nitrogen. The particular site-specific pattern in the impacts that we observed provides the first evidence that alien invasive species may contribute to a homogenisation of soil conditions in invaded landscapes.

AB  - In order to understand the successful spread of Ambrosia artemisiifolia in France, the variability of colonised habitat by this species was studied at 48 locations, from its central to peripheral area of distribution. Each site was characterised by a vegetation survey, a description of the A. artemisiifolia population and a soil analysis. Differences in the number of species, Shannon diversity index, evenness index and plant life form spectra were compared among the sites. A total of 276 species occurring along with A. artemisiifolia was observed. Therophytes and hemicryptophytes represented more than 80% of all the species. The two most frequent species occurring along with A. artemisiifolia were Chenopodium album and Polygonum aniculare. Multivariate analysis of vegetation surveys showed that A. artemisiifolia has a wide ecological tolerance. It colonises a large range of disturbed habitats differing in terms of vegetation cover, species composition and type of soil. The present study highlights the potential of A. artemisiifolia for invading spring crops and all seminatural or disturbed open areas. The success of its ongoing invasion can be explained by both its generalist character and the existence of vacant ecological niches, which are poorly occupied by the French native flora.

AU  - Kleijn, David

T2  - Ecology
AB  - Understanding population declines has been the objective of a wide range of ecological studies. When species have become rare such studies are complicated because particular behavior or life history traits may be the cause but also the result of the decline of a species. We approached this problem by studying species' characteristics on specimens that were collected before the onset of their decline and preserved in natural history museums. In northwestern Europe, some bumble bee species declined dramatically during the 20th century whereas other, ecologically similar, species maintained stable populations. A long-standing debate focuses on whether this is caused by declining species having stricter host plant preferences. We compared the composition of pollen loads of five bumble bee species with stable populations and five with declining populations using museum specimens collected before 1950 in Belgium, England, and The Netherlands. Prior to 1950, the number of plant taxa in pollen loads of declining species was almost one-third lower than that in stable species even though individuals of stable and declining species generally originated from the same areas. There were no systematic differences in the composition of pollen loads between stable and declining species, but the plant taxa preferred by declining species before 1950 had experienced a stronger decline in the 20th century than those preferred by stable species. In 2004 and 2005, we surveyed the areas where bumble bees had been caught in the past and compared the composition of past and present pollen loads of the stable, but not of the by now locally extinct declining species. The number of collected pollen taxa was similar, but the composition differed significantly between the two periods. Differences in composition reflected the major changes in land use in northwestern Europe but also the spread of the invasive plant species Impatiens glandulifera. The main question now is why declining species apparently were not able to switch to less preferred food plants when stable species were. This study shows that natural history collections can play an important role in improving our understanding of the ecological mechanisms driving species population change.

AB  - Invasive plants are, simply by occupying a large amount of space in invaded habitats, expected to impose a significant impact on the native vegetation and their associated food webs. However, little is known about the impact of invasive plants both on native vegetation and on different invertebrate feeding guilds at the habitat level. Yet, studies addressing multiple trophic levels, e.g. plant species, herbivores, predators and detrivores, are likely to yield additional insight into how and under which conditions invasive weeds alter ecosystem structures and processes. We set out to assess whether plant species richness and invertebrate assemblages in European riparian habitats invaded by exotic knotweeds (Fallopia spp.) differed from those found in native grassland- or bush-dominated riparian habitats, which are both potentially threatened by knotweed invasion. Our findings suggest that riparian habitats invaded by knotweeds support lower numbers of plant species and lower overall abundance and morphospecies richness of invertebrates, compared to native grassland-dominated and bush-dominated habitats. Total invertebrate abundance and morphospecies richness in Fallopia-invaded riparian habitats were correlated with native plant species richness, suggesting that there is a link between the replacement of native plant species by exotic Fallopia species and the reduction in overall invertebrate abundance and morphospecies richness. Moreover, biomass of invertebrates sampled in grassland and bush-dominated habitats was almost twice as high as that in Fallopia-invaded habitats. Large-scale invasion by exotic Fallopia species is therefore likely to seriously affect biodiversity and reduce the quality of riparian ecosystems for amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals whose diets are largely composed of arthropods.

T2  - Canadian Journal of Plant Science
AB  - Impatiens glandulifera Royle (Himalayan balsam) is an invasive alien annual up to 3 in in height with showy flowers that are generally pink or purplish. Native to the Himalayan region, I. glanditlifera was first recorded in Canada in 1901 in Ottawa, and is now found in eight Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. Impatiens glandulifera is typically found in riparian habitats and may spread rapidly because its seeds are readily transported via waterways. Up to 2500 seeds are produced per plant and dispersed explosively Lip to 5 in from the parent plant. This can result in dense monotypic stands which prevent establishment of native plants and make stream banks vulnerable to erosion when the shallow-rooted plants die back. Impatiens glandulifera is susceptible to glyphosate but because herbicide use in riparian areas is not advised, other control methods such as hand weeding, mowing or flaming have been used. Methods for eradication are most successful when upstream Populations are controlled first, Lis the plants spread downstream. Removal of I. glandulifera should be managed synchronously with non-native control measures and ideally be accompanied by planting native species to ensure the restoration of native species composition. The prognosis for curbing its spread in Canada seems poor as it has quite rapidly become established along waterways in many regions, following a pattern seen over the past two centuries in Europe.

T2  - Diversity and Distributions
AB  - Modelling the distribution of invasive alien species is widely used for predicting future dispersal, response to climate change, and effects of management, but little information is available on the scale dependence of spatial models. This study is focused on Heracleum mantegazzianum, a problematic invasive plant in central and north-western Europe. The main objective was to model the current distribution of this species at national (43,000 km(2)) and regional scale (4900 km(2)) using autologistic regression with a Danish data set. Presence-absence data were used in a grid system with 5 x 5 km(2) or 2 x 2 km(2) as basic units. To avoid misleading presence-absence models and unreliable probability values due to unbalanced data, the prevalence was used as cut-off value, and a favourability function was applied to the model predictions. The national model showed a widespread distribution of H. mantegazzianum with highest habitat suitability in the eastern and northern parts of the country where human population density is high, winters more severe and/or loamy soils more common. At a regional scale the distribution of H. mantegazzianum is associated with alluvial sand cover, high human population density, spring precipitation, and presence of the species in neighbour grid units. The observed widespread national distribution is likely the result of anthropogenic spread of this ornamental plant, while the locally clumped distribution suggests that H. mantegazzianum naturally spreads mainly over short distances. The current distribution in Denmark resembles an intermediate invasion stage where long-distance dispersal is less important, while spread from suitable neighbour habitats is significant. The study demonstrates that the favourability function leads to improved mapping standards for invasive species.

AB  - The paper presents the results of several years investigations (2003-2007) on two invaders: the Himalayans Impatiens glandulifera and Asiatic Reynoutfia japonica. The Sudety Mountains and their national parks are under strong pressure of both species, threatening the local vegetation. The four-year investigations have been carried out in field, glasshouse and in laboratory. lnvasive species have their peculiar life histories which help them to occupy new areas. Those are above all the specific generative reproduction strategies (Impatiens) or vegetative reproduction strategies (Reynoutria). Both strategies secure the reproductive success and to capture more and more highly situated areas of the mountains. Very significant characteristics connected with the expansion of invaders is the excessively over and above the average production of seeds (Impatiens) and a huge annual increment aboveground biomass (Reynoutria). The investigated invasive species are probably not equipped with influence of allelopatic type as of greater importance is their competitive strength. The invaders can eliminate a part of the early spring flora belonging to the geophyte group and impoverish the regional biological diversity. Both the invasive plants enter also into some moist mountain forest communities.

AB  - Invasive plant species are widely recognised to have severe ecological impacts in a wide range of ecosystems throughout the world, yet there are few experimental studies measuring community-level effects of invasive plant species. Thus most evidence is from correlative studies, and as such often cannot easily disentangle cause and effect. Through a combination of an addition and removal experiment and a correlative approach (multi-site comparisons), this study aimed to quantify the effects of a widespread invasive species, Mimulus guttatus, on species richness and soil properties of riparian plant communities. The marked negative association between Mimulus cover and plant species richness identified through correlative multi-site comparisons was consistent with experimental removal studies which indicate Mimulus significantly alters the structure of riparian plant communities. Total C and N and soil moisture were marginally higher in invaded than in uninvaded disturbed sediment plots. Following Mimulus removal, there was an increase in the occurrence and abundance of another non-native species, Claytonia sibirica, as well as germination and establishment of Mimulus seedlings. This highlights that, although removal increased richness, bringing the plant community closer structurally to uninvaded vegetation, the application of removal as a management tool needs to be undertaken with caution, as it may create opportunities for other invaders. The impact of Mimulus appeared restricted to disturbed sediment communities, as addition experiments into herb-grass communities were relatively unsuccessful in establishing Mimulus. These patterns were consistent with the distribution of the species in riparian plant communities. The addition experiments highlight that, as well as competition from the resident vegetation community, mollusc herbivory Further hinders the establishment of Mimulus. Many manipulation studies have removed invasive plant species from heavily invaded communities, and it is often thought that invasive species usually affect plant community structure only where their cover is high. This study is unique in demonstrating impacts where cover of the invasive plant is relatively low. (C) 2008 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

T2  - Perspectives in Plant Ecology Evolution and Systematics
AB  - Climatic warming and land use change are likely to facilitate range expansions in invasive plant species, although the ability to predict such changes requires a better mechanistic understanding of the biological limits of populations. The introduced weed Oxalis pes-caprae, a significant pest of cultivation in many Mediterranean-type ecosystems, presents a suitable case study. The species distribution in the Mediterranean Basin closely follows that of olive Cultivation, limited to below 600 m; yet its potential to colonise Vulnerable areas at higher elevations has yet to be adequately assessed. To investigate the possibility, plant performance was assessed by experimentally sowing O. pes-caprae bulbils along an altitudinal gradient in the Lefka Ori mountains, Crete. The survivorship and bulbil biomass of the resulting plants all declined significantly with elevation, irrespective of soil type, initial bulbil size or seasonal variation. Whilst plants survived vegetatively up to 1400 in, seasonal bulbil productivity, likely to be critical to population viability, exceeded that of the sown bulbil biomass only below 750 in. These data indicate that the current elevation of O. pes-caprae is close to, but not at, its current climatic limit, and that low propagule pressure and scarcity of suitable habitat probably also act to limit the altitudinal distribution. Plant performance was correlated strongly with the duration of spring snow cover. Despite a 2 degrees C difference in mean spring temperatures in the 2 years of study, the predicted elevational change was only 37 m higher in the milder conditions. Overall, our results suggest that while O. pes-caprae performance is strongly linked to climate and is Currently close to its climatic limit on Crete, there is limited scope for further spread unless land use and/or propagule pressure change at higher elevations. For this species, these elements are likely to be more significant drivers of invasion risk than the predicted changes of future climates. (C) 2008 Rubell Foundation, ETH Zurich.

T2  - Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
AB  - In this paper we develop a Bayesian approach to parameter estimation in a stochastic spatio-temporal model of the spread of invasive species across a landscape. To date, statistical techniques, such as logistic and autologistic regression, have outstripped stochastic spatio-temporal models in their ability to handle large numbers of covariates. Here we seek to address this problem by making use of a range of covariates describing the bio-geographical features of the landscape. Relative to regression techniques, stochastic spatio-temporal models are more transparent in their representation of biological processes. They also explicitly model temporal change, and therefore do not require the assumption that the species' distribution (or other spatial pattern) has already reached equilibrium as is often the case with standard statistical approaches. In order to illustrate the use of such techniques we apply them to the analysis of data detailing the spread of an invasive plant, Heracleum mantegazzianum, across Britain in the 20th Century using geo-referenced covariate information describing local temperature, elevation and habitat type. The use of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling within a Bayesian framework facilitates statistical assessments of differences in the suitability of different habitat classes for H. mantegazzianum, and enables predictions of future spread to account for parametric uncertainty and system variability. Our results show that ignoring such covariate information may lead to biased estimates of key processes and implausible predictions of future distributions.

AB  - Studies of pairwise interactions have shown that an alien plant can affect the pollination of a native plant, this effect being mediated by shared pollinators. Here we use a manipulative field experiment, to investigate the impact of the alien plant Impatiens glandulifera on an entire community of coflowering native plants. Visitation and pollen transport networks were constructed to compare replicated I. glandulifera invaded and I. glandulifera removal plots. Invaded plots had significantly higher visitor species richness, visitor abundance and flower visitation. However, the pollen transport networks were dominated by alien pollen grains in the invaded plots and consequently higher visitation may not translate in facilitation for pollination. The more generalized insects were more likely to visit the alien plant, and Hymenoptera and Hemiptera were more likely to visit the alien than Coleoptera. Our data indicate that generalized native pollinators can provide a pathway of integration for alien plants into native visitation systems.

AB  - Resource competition is commonly invoked to explain negative effects of invasive plants on native plant abundance. If invasives out-compete natives, global changes that elevate resource availability may interact with invasives to exacerbate impacts on native communities. Indeed, evidence is accumulating that elevated CO2 and N deposition decrease native biomass and simultaneously increase invasive biomass. However, superior competitive ability, and a relative increase in the magnitude of invasive impacts under elevated resource availability, remain to be definitively proven. Using model, multi-species, multi-individual riparian plant communities, where planting density was maintained by replacement of native with exotic individuals, we conducted a greenhouse, competition experiment using native (to the UK) and invaded communities exposed to ambient and elevated CO2 (CO2 experiment) or N availability (N experiment). We tested two hypotheses: (1) invasives are superior competitors to natives at ambient atmospheric CO2 and N deposition; (2) negative effects of invasives on natives are exacerbated under elevated CO2 or N availability. Our results provide some support for the first hypothesis: in the CO2 experiment native biomass was significantly lower in invaded communities. In the N experiment, native biomass was unaffected by the presence of exotics but other characteristics (e.g. root:shoot ratios) were altered. Differences in light availability between the experiments may have modified the effects of the invasives on the native assemblages but our design did not permit us to determine this definitively. The hypothesis that elevated CO2 and N availability benefit invasives at the expense of natives was not supported by our results. This may be explained either because the invasives showed minor responses to the resource manipulations or because native and exotic species were differentially limited by CO2 and N. Our results confirm the expectation that invasives alter the characteristics of native assemblages but lead us to question whether elevated resource availability will magnify these effects.

AB  - Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam) is an invasive riparian plant species that can outcompete native perennials. Population genetic data on dispersal may aid in the management of invasive species, so we have developed microsatellite markers for this significant invader using an intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR)-based cloning method. Eight polymorphic markers displayed between two and five alleles, with overall levels of observed and expected heterozygosities ranging from 0.0500 to 0.7500 and from 0.1449 to 0.7692, respectively.

AB  - The absence of fungal or viral diseases of some invasive alien plants partially explains their success. However, for several species this issue has not been studied and no account of such infections are recorded for Impatiens glandulifera, a problematic weed in moist and half-open habitats of central and western Europe. We record for the first time viral infections in plants from different European regions grown in a common garden experiment. The infection was systemic and could be transferred to two species of Chenopodium and five species of Nicotiana, and resulted in the development of local necrotic spots within a week. The symptoms resembled Tobacco Rattle Virus, but this was not confirmed by an ELISA-test. In L glandulifera the virus led to reduced above-ground biomass. Relative stem biomass and basal diameter were also lower in diseased plants, but there was no significant differences in plant height and number of main branches. Also virus infection did not affect the following reproductive traits: time to flowering, pollen viability, fruit abortion, seed/ovule ratio, seed number per fruit and individual seed mass. This virus was not transmitted via seed. The potential effects of such viral infections on the population dynamics and biological control of this alien plant are discussed.

AB  - Rivers are conduits for materials and energy; this, the frequent and intense disturbances that these systems experience, and their narrow, linear nature, create problems for conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the face of increasing human influence. In most parts of the world, riparian zones are highly modified. Changes caused by alien plants - or environmental changes that facilitate shifts in dominance creating novel ecosystems - are often important agents of perturbation in these systems. Many restoration projects are underway. Objective frameworks based on an understanding of biogeographical processes at different spatial scales (reach, segment, catchment), the specific relationships between invasive plants and resilience and ecosystem functioning, and realistic endpoints are needed to guide sustainable restoration initiatives. This paper examines the biogeography and the determinants of composition and structure of riparian vegetation in temperate and subtropical regions and conceptualizes the components of resilience in these systems. We consider changes to structure and functioning caused by, or associated with, alien plant invasions, in particular those that lead to breached abiotic- or biotic thresholds. These pose challenges when formulating restoration programmes. Pervasive and escalating human-mediated changes to multiple factors and at a range of scales in riparian environments demand innovative and pragmatic approaches to restoration. The application of a new framework accommodating such complexity is demonstrated with reference to a hypothetical riparian ecosystem under three scenarios: (1) system unaffected by invasive plants; (2) system initially uninvaded, but with flood-generated incursion of alien plants and escalating invasion-driven alteration; and (3) system affected by both invasions and engineering interventions. The scheme has been used to derive a decision-making framework for restoring riparian zones in South Africa and could guide similar initiatives in other parts of the world.

AB  - 1 We investigated the role of non-native species (neophytes) in common British plant communities using botanical data from two stratified random surveys carried out in 1990 and 1998. 2 We found that from 16 851 plots surveyed in 1998 there were 123 non-native species found mostly in arable, tall grass/herb and fertile grassland habitats. Invasive non-native species, e.g. Fallopia japonica, Impatiens glandulifera and Rhododendron ponticum, were uncommon in this survey. 3 Between 1990 and 1998 the total number of non-native species increased but the mean number of species per sample plot decreased. The mean cover of non-natives increased from 1.2% to 1.9%. 4 There were positive spatial and temporal relationships between non-native and native species diversity. However, there was a weak negative relationship between changes in non-native cover and native diversity. 5 The species composition and ecological traits of communities containing non-natives were very different from those that did not contain them. 6 In the British countryside non-native species were mainly found in habitats with anthropogenic associations, high fertility, high number of ruderal species and high diversity. There is also an indication that successional shifts where competitive invasive species dominate involve non-native species. 7 National-scale changes in plant community composition are likely to be closely correlated with external land-use impacts. Changes such as eutrophication, nitrogen deposition and increased fertility in infertile habitats are likely to benefit both native and non-native invasive species; however, currently these trends benefit native species much more often than non-natives. 8 Non-native species are known to have significant effects on native species at local scales in many countries; however, at the landscape scale in Great Britain they are best considered as symptoms of disturbance and land-use change rather than a direct threat to biodiversity.

TI  - What is the impact of Impatiens glandulifera on species diversity of invaded riparian vegetation?
AU  - Hejda, Martin
AU  - Pysek, Petr
T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - Effect of invasion by Impatiens glandulifera (Balsaminaceae) on the community characteristics and species composition of invaded riparian communities was studied at six rivers in the Czech Republic. Two approaches were used: space for time substitution approach, i.e., comparing invaded and uninvaded sites under the same habitat conditions, and removal of the invader from experimental plots. Differences in the number of species, Shannon diversity index H' and evennes J were compared between invaded and uninvaded plots. Uninvaded plots of the comparative study harboured by 0.23 more species per 16 m(2), and had higher value of H' and J, calculated with species covers as importance values; however only the difference in J was marginally significant (p = 0.04). Other effects were not significant, indicating that once I. glandulifera is removed, communities recover without any consequences for species diversity. Multivariate analysis did not reveal any effect of invasion on the species composition in terms of species presence but their cover hierarchies changed after the invasion, as I. glandulifera became dominant at the expense of tall native nitrophilous dominants. It is concluded that I. glandulifera exerts negligible effect on the characteristics of invaded riparian communities, hence it does not represent threat to the plant diversity of invaded areas. This makes it very different from other Central European invasive aliens of a similar performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - Palaeogeography Palaeoclimatology Palaeoecology
AB  - Karst cave systems are well developed in Wales (UK) and, in some instances, constitute important bat roosts. Ogof Draenen, near Blaenavon in south-east Wales, is the most recent major cave discovery (1994) with already > 70 km of passages explored spanning a vertical range of 148 m. With the exception of one small chamber (Siambre Ddu) located directly above the main Ogof Draenen system, very few bats have been noticed inside. Extensive accumulations of guano, attributable to Rhinolophus hipposideros, are however found in parts of the Ogof Draenen system. In places covering many square metres and sometimes building heaps > 0.5 m thick, these represent volumes not yet found in any other cave system in the British Isles. Although the date of the abandonment of the main Ogof Draenen system as a bat roost remains unknown, six radiocarbon dates on guano from Ogof Draenen place the occupation in the Iron Age to Medieval period at least. Palynological analysis was undertaken on ten samples distributed through the cave. Comparisons were made with a moss polster and a lake mud sample from the area to provide a first approximation of the regional modem pollen rain and with two modem guano samples, one from Siambre Ddu and one from Agen Allwedd cave (5 km to the north-west) to provide a temporal comparison with the fossil guano. Agen Allwedd cave currently is one of the largest active roosts for Lesser Horseshoe bats in Britain and lies close to the present northern limit of this endangered species in Europe. The main results are that (1) the cave appears to have been used both as a summer and a winter roost; (2) most of the Ogof Draenen guano is formed within c. 1600 C-14 years and, if the largest heap is continuous, it has accumulated within 750 C-14 years, i.e. 0.16 mm yr(-1); 3) the fossil guano samples reflect a relatively closed oak forest with more abundant ivy (Hedera) and holly (Ilex) than at present; (4) insect-pollinated plants such as Ilex, Acer, Hedera and Impatiens glandulifera are over-represented in the guano samples; (5) in addition to the usual causes of bat roost decline (pesticides, pollution), in the case of Ogof Draenen, we may add entrance blocked by rock collapse and decline of the local forest cover as well as change in its composition.

T2  - Biodiversity and Conservation
AB  - Alien plants may be reproductively limited in exotic habitats because of a lack of mutualistic pollinators. However, if plants are adequately served by generalist pollinators, successful reproduction, naturalisation and expansion into exotic habitats may occur. Rhododendron ponticum is very successful, ecologically damaging invasive plant in Britain and Ireland, but is in decline in its native Iberian habitat. It spreads locally by sending out lateral branches, but for longer distance dispersal it relies on sexually produced seeds. Little is known about R. ponticum's pollination ecology and breeding biology in invaded habitats. We examined the flower-visiting communities and maternal reproductive success of R. ponticum in native populations in southern Spain and in exotic ones in Ireland. R. ponticum in flowers are visited by various generalist (polylectic) pollinator species in both native and exotic habitats. Although different species visited flowers in Ireland and Spain, the flower visitation rate was not significantly different. Insects foraging on R. ponticum in Spain carried less R. ponticum pollen than their Irish counterparts, and carried fewer pollen types. Fruit production per inflorescence varied greatly within all populations but was significantly correlated with visitation at the population level. Nectar was significantly depleted by insects in some exotic populations, suggesting that this invasive species is providing a floral resource for native insects in some parts of Ireland. The generality of the pollination system may be factor contributing to R.ponticum's success in exotic habitats.

TI  - Assessing the impact of Impatiens glandulifera on riparian habitats: partitioning diversity components following species removal
AU  - Hulme, P. E.
AU  - Bremner, E. T.
T2  - Journal of Applied Ecology
AB  - 1. Attempts to quantify the impact of non-native plants on the vegetation of invaded habitats have often been criticized because of the frequent use of observational assessments (invaded/uninvaded comparisons) focused on local- rather than community-level effects. This study highlights how removal experiments combined with partitioning of diversity components across spatial scales can provide key insights into invasive species' impacts. 2. Impatiens glandulifera (Balsaminaceae) is a widespread invasive riparian weed, yet few quantitative assessments of its impact on natural vegetation exist. Thus replicated experiments were used to compare the impact of Impatiens removal on alpha, beta, gamma components of species richness, diversity and evenness in open riparian habitats in north-east England. 3. Plant community response to Impatiens removal was rapid, with a significant increase in seedling recruitment resulting in an average increase of four species m(-2). The impact of Impatiens invasion was most marked for light-demanding species. Eight non-native species (in addition to Impatiens) occurred in the community and these responded proportionally more to Impatiens removal than native species. As a result the proportion of non-native species in removal plots was higher than in invaded plots. 4. The increase in alpha richness and diversity following Impatiens removal was matched by a similar increase in the gamma components. Thus the effect of Impatiens was significant at both the local plot scale and at the scale of the riparian community, although the former effect was more marked. Species accumulation curves suggested that extensive Impatiens stands may reduce species richness by as much as 25%. 5. Synthesis and applications. Removal experiments appear particularly well suited to assess the impacts of herbaceous non-native plants on ruderal communities. By partitioning diversity components, impacts were consistently assessed at local and community scales and, when combined with analysis of species accumulation curves, provided a comprehensive assessment of impact on the plant community. The approach adopted in this study highlights that although Impatiens reduces native species diversity in open and frequently disturbed riparian vegetation, many of the species negatively influenced by Impatiens are widespread ruderal species. Furthermore, management may lead to a compensatory increase in the abundance of other non-native species and thus fail to achieve desired conservation goals.

T2  - Basic and Applied Ecology
AB  - Species invasions have been a central theme in ecology over the past decades, with a focus on invasions of non-indigenous European species in the New World. However, within Europe, native species may also become invasive. Such species rapidly increase their geographic range and may at the same time broaden their ecological amplitude. We report on Lactuca serriola L., which has shown a rapid range expansion in many parts of Europe. We reconstructed its geographical spread through The Netherlands; furthermore, we tested for changes in its ecological amplitude. Before 1950, L. serriola was rare in The Netherlands, recorded from only 80 grid-cells (of 5 x 5 km(2)). Subsequently, its distribution increased from 219 grid-cells (1980), to 546 cells (990) and 998 grid cells (2000). It currently occupies at least 60% of The Netherlands. Analyses of relevees demonstrate, using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), that the variance in the assemblage of species co-occurring with L. serriola increased significantly since 1940, indicating that the species currently occurs in a broader range of vegetation types. Correlating averages of Ellenberg's indicator values per vegetation relevee with time, we found correlations for continentality (+), acidity (-) and (soil) humidity (+). Moreover, the proportion of phanerophytes in the relevees increased over time. These findings suggest that in addition to its original ruderal. habitat, L. serriola also currently occurs, in more closed vegetation types. Based on analyses of two other co-occurring Asteraceae species, we showed that these patterns were specific for L. serriola only. We conclude that L. serriola has broadened its ecological amplitude and discuss four mutually non-exclusive explanations for the recent invasiveness of L. serriola: (i) Effects of a changed environment: global. warming and ruderalisation; (ii) metapopulation dynamics and increased diaspore pressure; (iii) microevolution; IN) genetic reinforcement due to hybridisation with conspecific (crop) species.

AB  - Background and Aims The summer annual Impatiens glandulifera can reach 3 in in height within deciduous woodland. The primary objective was to determine if NO(3)(-) accumulation, and hence its osmotic effect, is an important physiological mechanism allowing Impatiens to achieve substantial height under low irradiance. Methods Stem extension, concentrations of K(+) and NO(3)(-) in leaves and concentrations of K(+), NO(3)(-) and other inorganic anions, malate, sugars, total N and total osmoticum in stem were measured in L glandulifera sampled at different irradiance levels in deciduous woodland and in a glasshouse. Also, the energetic costs, as absorbed photons, of generating osmolarity in stein cell vacuoles with KNO(3), K(2)malate or hexose sugar were determined. Key Results Results were similar in the woodland and glasshouse. At 50-100% relative irradiance (Ir; open ground PAR = 100% Ir) and 2-10% Ir, plant height increased from 7-14 cut to 130-154 cm in 64-67 d. Leaf and stem NO(3)(-) concentrations were negligible at 50-100% Ir while K(+), malate(2-) and sugars, respectively, accounted for 33.2-50.1%, 19.3-20.8% and 2.0-2.6% of total osmoticum in stems. At 2-10% Ir, NO(3)(-) concentrations were four to eight times greater in stems than leaves. Here, NO(3)(-) constituted 26.7-34.3% of the total osmotic concentration in the stem and NO(3)(-)-N constituted 69-81% of total N in stem tissue. Also at 2-10% Ir, K(+) comprised 44.9-45.9% and malate plus sugars 2.2-3.1% of total osmotic concentration. The energy cost of osmoticum as KNO(3) was calculated as less than half that of malate and less than one-seventh that for hexose. Further calculations suggest that use of KNO(3), K(2)malate or glucose as osmoticum at low irradiance would, respectively, cost approx. 7%, 16% and 50% of the total construction cost of the stem. Conclusions It is concluded that accumulation of NO(3) in place of organic molecules in stems is an important mechanism allowing L glandulifera to achieve substantial height at low irradiance.

T2  - Marine Ecology Progress Series
AB  - To date, estuarine ecosystem research has mostly neglected silica cycling in freshwater intertidal marshes. However, tidal marshes can store large amounts of biogenic silica (BSi) in vegetation and sediment. BSi content of the typical freshwater marsh plants Phragmites australis, Impatiens glandulifera, Urtica dioica, Epilobium hirsutum and Salix sp. was analysed year-round. All herbaceous species accumulated silica in their tissue during their life cycle. Of the live plants, P. australis contained the most BSi (accumulating from 6 to 55 mg g(-1)). Dead shoots of P. australis had the highest BSi content (up to 72.2 mg g(-1)). U. dioica (<11.1 mg g(-1)), I. glandulifera (<1.1 mg g(-1)), E. hirsutum (<1.2 mg g(-1)) and Salix sp. (<1.9 mg g(-1)) had a much lower BSi content. Except for R australis rhizomes (<15 mg g(-1)) underground biomass contained low amounts of BSi (<6 mg g(-1)). Sediment BSi content decreased from the surface (9 to 10 mg g(-1)) to deeper layers (5 to 7 mg g(-1)), There was seasonal variation in sediment BSi. Dissolved Si in porewater was highest in summer (ca. 600 mu M) and lowest in winter (ca. 400 mu M). P. australis vegetation (aboveground and roots) contained up to 126 g m(-2) BSi, while the upper 30 cm of sediment accumulated up to 1500 g m(-2), making sediment the largest BSi reservoir in the marsh. We conclude that P. australis wetlands could be an essential, but unrecognised, sink for BSi in the biogeochemical cycling of Si.

AU  - Willis, S. G.
AU  - Hulme, P. E.
T2  - Functional Ecology
AB  - 1. Seed mass is widely regarded as a key plant trait, yet is notoriously variable within an individual species. This study reports the first field experiments to disentangle the relative importance of four major correlates of seed mass variation: resource limitation; plant height; seed number; and seasonality. 2. Variation in reproductive traits in Impatiens glandulifera Royle was partitioned among six populations established across an elevation gradient, among plants at each elevation and within individual plants. 3. Seed mass was the least variable trait both at the individual and population levels, while the number of pods per plant varied most. Seed mass variation was greatest among individual plants (42%) and was least among populations (28%). 4. Taller plants produced proportionally more seed pods and more seeds per pod. Seed mass was not related to the number of pods per plant, or the number of seeds per pod. Thus with increasing resources, I. glandulifera allocated resources to produce more seeds rather than larger seeds. 5. Seed mass was negatively correlated with the heat sum over the period of seed maturation, explaining increased seed mass at higher elevations and increasing seed mass over time at most elevations. This may indicate that environmental condition pre- and post-fertilization determines the relationship between seed mass and elevation, thereby limiting the potential for evolutionary selection for seed-size optima. 6. The study warns against correlative studies of seed mass variation that select arbitrary populations or ignore the temporal dynamics in seed mass, as these may generate spurious correlations among life-history traits. 7. The success of I. glandulifera as an invasive species may reflect the extended period of seed release, considerable seed mass variation and large seed size under conditions of environmental severity. These traits will facilitate the exploitation of spatially and temporally heterogeneous natural environments commonly found in riparian ecosystems.

AU  - Kollmann, J.

T2  - Diversity and Distributions
AB  - Geographical differentiation of populations can be interpreted as a result of adaptive processes in response to environmental gradients and biotic interactions. Such adaptations are particularly interesting in invasive alien species which have been present in an area for a relatively short time. There are few observations of latitudinal trends in alien plants, and no account exists for Impatiens glandulifera, a problematic annual weed in most countries of central and north-western Europe. Here we describe variation in growth and phenology in 26 populations of this species from nine European regions in a common garden in Denmark. Above-ground biomass (an estimate of fecundity), height and basal diameter were lower in the northern populations which were first to produce flowers. Some differences were also observed in biomass allocation to leaves, flowers and fruits, albeit without a latitudinal pattern. The latitudinal trends in growth and survival disappeared in a field experiment, probably due to suboptimal site conditions. Most variation in plant traits was explained by differences among regions with some minor effects of populations within regions. Besides latitude, no other geographical, climatic or population trait correlated with the observed differences in growth and phenology. Differences in latitude may mainly represent variation in length of the growing season. The causes and potential consequences of such latitudinal trends for population dynamics and dispersal of alien plants are discussed.

TI  - Biological invasions: winning the science battles but losing the conservation war?
AU  - Hulme, P. E.
T2  - Oryx
AB  - Biological invasions by non-indigenous species (NIS) are widely recognized as a significant component of human-caused global environmental change. However, the standard programme of mapping distributions, predicting future ranges, modelling species spread, assessing impacts, developing management guidelines and screening species suffers from a number of serious limitations. NIS distribution maps can often be as misleading as they are instructive. Perceptions of the intensity, scale and rate of invasion are a function of mapping resolution, and the lack of common mapping standards prevents accurate comparative assessments. Coarse resolution data may overestimate the role of climate in the invasion process relative to other variables such as land use or human population density. Climate envelopes have therefore been widely used to predict species future ranges, but often overestimate potential distributions. Without an appropriate mechanistic understanding of the invasion process, correlative approaches may misinterpret the relative risks posed by different NIS. In addition, statistical models of invasion fail to encapsulate the complexity of human-mediated dispersal, which includes such diverse processes as transatlantic timber trade, horticultural fashion and the continuing expansion of road networks. Screening tools based on species traits, taxonomy and/or invasion history can sometimes result in high discrimination rates. Yet where the cost of false positives outweighs the risks from false negatives, a higher discriminatory power is required. Certain research outputs have perhaps been counterproductive in the war against invasive species. Studies have highlighted that only a tiny proportion of NIS are invasive, that most invasions occur in human dominated rather than pristine ecosystems, that indigenous and non-indigenous species are sufficiently similar that their impacts may not necessarily be different, and that there is evidence that introduced species augment rather than reduce species diversity. It is crucial to address these wider perceptions of the problem in order to mobilize the resources necessary for a global invasive species management programme.

AB  - The possibility of indirect (apparent) competition between the alien Impatiens glandulifera Royle and the native Hyacinthoides non-scripta (L.) Chouard ex Rothm. via molluscan herbivores was investigated. Twenty-four 1 m(2) permanent quadrats were located in woodland in north-west England and half planted with I. glandulifera. Molluscicide treatment significantly improved all measures of invasion success of I. glandulifera. There was no significant effect of molluscicide treatment on cover of H. non-scripta. The period from mid April to mid May was found to be crucial for invasion success of I. glandulffiera in woodland with cover of H. non-scripta significantly affecting future productivity of I. glandulifera. There is therefore evidence for indirect competition via slugs as well as direct competition between the two species.

TI  - Does temperature limit the invasion of Impatiens glandulifera and Heracleum mantegazzianum in the UK?
AU  - Willis, S. G.
AU  - Hulme, P. E.
T2  - Functional Ecology
AB  - 1. Impatiens glandulifera Royle and Heracleum mantegazzianum Sommier et Levier are widespread, non-indigenous plant species in the UK. A variety of correlational analyses suggest that their spatial extent is limited by climate, although no experimental studies have tested this hypothesis. This paper reports the first detailed experimental examination of the impact of climate on the performance of the two species. 2. Seeds of each species were sown, in each of 2 years, in replicated plots along an elevational gradient (10-600 m a.s.l.) in north-east England. Both species germinated readily at all elevations, even in areas well above their current limits within the study area. The plants were, however, smaller at higher altitudes. Impatiens glandulifera also produced fewer seeds with increasing elevation. 3. Plant performance was assessed in relation to actual and interpolated climate data along the elevational transect. For H. mantegazzianum , the timing of germination was correlated most strongly with the pre-emergence heat sum; for I. glandulifera this relationship was significant in one year only. Maximum height of both species was correlated with increasing post-emergence heat sum, as was pod production by I. glandulifera . The biomass of second-year H. mantegazzianum plants varied non-linearly with post-emergence heat sum. For both species, overwinter survival of seeds was not related to winter temperature or frost days. Overwinter survival of first-year H. mantegazzianum plants declined with increasing frost incidence. 4. The results suggest that, of the two species, only I. glandulifera is currently most limited by temperature, although this is not the only factor determining the distribution of the species.

AB  - Management of water-bodies affected by prolific growths of plants pose several problems related to assessment of created imbalances. The intensity of these phenomena should be considered on both spatial and temporal scales, as well as the impact of negative effects on practical uses of the water-bodies by man. An examination of invading growths recorded on the French hydrographic system has been carried out. As a result, an inventory of the most relevant plants was produced, called "risk species" belonging to different macrophyte groups like macro-algae, native hydrophyte phanerogams as Ranunculus sp., Potamogeton sp., Myriophyllum sp., Ceratophyllum sp., Lemna sp., and introduced phanerogams like Elodea sp., Lagarosiphon sp., Ludwigia sp., Myriophyllum aquaticum. Some helophyte plants, Cyanobacteria and two riparian introduced species (Fallopia japonica and Impatiens glandulifera), have also been considered. Biological strategies determine their proliferation potential by developing high growth and substantial propagation abilities, through some special morphological and physiological features and means of reproduction. Environment types and factors favour this capacity. These favourable environments are connected with environmental conditions such as high irradiation, mostly linked to shallow depth and water warming, stable or low hydrological conditions, high mineralization and trophic level. The occurrence of dense vegetation is usually the combination of these two aspects, with the influence of mostly several favourable factors. Some situations of minimal and maximal risks can be defined. This knowledge should improve understanding of these events and provide more information for management and control practices.

Maximal content (0.8-1.1%) of 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and its 2-methylated derivative was observed in flowers collected between July and August. The procedure was applied to compare the pigment content in three other species of Impatiens but showed 2.5-37 times lower levels than those found in I. glandulifera.

T2  - Progress in Physical Geography
AB  - Biological invasions are a threat to ecosystems across all biogeographical realms. Riparian habitats are considered to be particularly prone to invasion by alien plant species and, because riparian vegetation plays a key role in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, research in this field has increased. Most studies have focused on the biology and autecology of invasive species and biogeographical aspects of their spread. However, given that hydrogeomorphological processes greatly influence the structure of riparian plant communities, and that these communities in turn affect hydrology and fluvial geomorphology, scant attention has been paid to the interactions between invasions and these physical precesses. Similarly, relatively little research has been undertaken on competitive interactions between alien and native riparian plant species. Further research in these fields is necessary at a variety of spatial and temporal scales before the dynamics of riparian invasions, and their impacts, can be properly understood.

AU  - Weber, E.
T2  - Conservation Biology
AB  - The homoclime approach has been used to estimate the potential distributions of the exotic golden-rods Solidago altissima, S. gigantea, and S. graminifolia in Europe. These three rhizomatous perennial plants were introduced as ornamentals about 250 years ago. Whereas S. altissima and S. gigantea have become wide-spread and serious invaders of abandoned fields, forest edges, and river banks, S. graminifolia is still confined to a few sites in Europe. Climatic profiles of their native ranges have been established for each species based on nine parameters from stations throughout their American ranges. I determined potential distributions for each species by mapping European stations that match the climatic profiles The potential distributions of all three species are substantially larger than their current distributions in Europe. Areas not yet colonized but predicted to be climatically suitable included parts of southern and southeastern Europe, Scandinavia, and the Middle East. Among the three species, the potentia range of S. altissima was largest in its latitudinal extent. The discrepancy between current and potential range was highest in S. graminifolia because of its restricted distribution. My results strongly suggest that the spread of S. altissima and S. gigantea has not yet reached its limits and that their range expansion will continue. Large parts of Europe were estimated to be climatically suitable to S. graminifolia, but invasion has not yet occurred. This species is either in lag phase or its spread is limited by factors other than climate.

T2  - Entomologia Generalis
AB  - The Turkish warty cabbage (or Russian old man) Bunias orientalis (Linnaeus 1753) is an extremely succcesful invasive plant species, which has firmly established itself in many central European habitats, and is rapidly expanding. For the first time, the nectar production and pollinators of this plant species are described, in order to predict its value as a food source for native insects. In addition, this study aims to predict possible competitive interactions with native plants in the context of pollination. It was found that nectar production per flower in B orientalis is relatively low. However, because of the extremely high number of flowers per plant and per area this plant is a valuable food source for energetically demanding visitors such as bumble bees and honeybees. These are the most common visitors to B orientalis, even though classical pollination syndromes would categorise this flower as fly-pollinated. Since B orientalis is an attractive nectar source, it is conceivable that there is a negative impact of its presence on the fitness of native species, simply by depressing visitation frequencies to other species.

AB  - The native perennial Urtica dioica and the invasive alien annual Impatiens glandulifera often co-occur in European riparian herb communities. This paper aims to answer two questions: i) can l. glandulifera outcompete U. dioica: and ii) how does hydrology influence competition? Two mesocosm experiments assessed growth of, and competition between, the two species when subjected firstly to three water-table regimes and secondly to five flood treatments. Results indicated that both species preferred lower water-tables and that floods early in spring adversely affected their growth. Deposition of sediment during flooding appeared to have little effect. Presence of U. dioica appeared to inhibit germination and, in flooded treatments. growth of l. glandulifera. However, during the water-table experiment, U. dioica plants grown in mixed cultures with l. glandulifera showed significantly reduced growth at the end of season compared to those grown in monocultures. This indicates that. once established. l. glandulifera can have a negative effect on U. dioica. These results point to a rare case of an annual species, l. glandulifera, out-competing a perennial, U. dioica. They also have implications for the biodiversity and management of riparian habitats.

AB  - The spatial distribution and abundance of some important invasive plant species have been surveyed in the Orseg Landscape Protection Area (OLPA) in Western Hungary, situated in the former "Iron Curtain Zone". During field studies performed within "The Natural History of Orseg" research program, high values of invasion of the natural or seminatural habitats were found. Despite the fact that the area was "undisturbed" for decades, these values are similar to other parts of Western Hungary. The main aim was to investigate the role invasive alien plants play in the transformation of the original vegetation. 75 % of the 24 spreading species recorded in the region of the OLPA are invasive aliens. 66 % of the latter are of North American origin and 50%. of them belong to the family Asteraceae. The invasive alien plants that most endanger the natural habitats of the region are: Solidago gigantea. Fallopia x bohemica. Helianthus tuberosus agg., Impatiens glandulifera, Aster lanceolatus agg. The range of these and other alien invasive taxa were studied in detail on maps with a 2.5 x 2.5 km UTM grid. Plant communities invaded by these plant species were also recorded. In addition. the small-scale and slow expansion of a few native species is also demonstrable (e.g. Calamagrostis epigeios. Sambucus ebulas. Urtica dioica).

AB  - 1. The existence of a hierarchical scheme of environmental controls on the spatial distribution of plant species was explored fbr three non-indigenous weeds, Fallopia japonica, Heracleum mantegazzianum and Impatiens glandulifera, in the British Isles. 2. Logistic regression analyses of the presence/absence of the three weed species examined the relative importance of 60 environmental variables, encompassing land cover, geology and climate. Analyses were undertaken using variables assessed at a hectad (10 x 10 km) or tetrad (2 x 2 km) resolution at national (England and Wales) and regional (County Durham, UK) spatial extents. 3. The ranges of all three species in the British Isles are currently increasing, and the non-equilibrium nature of their distribution limited the goodness-of-fit of logistic models. Interpretation of whether a species has expanded to occupy entirely its potential spatial range was scale-dependent, and species' distributions, when viewed at coarser spatial scales, may be more likely to be interpreted as having reached stasis. 4. Spatial autocorrelation was more evident at the finer tetrad spatial resolution for both F. japonica and I. glandulifera, but not evident at all for H. mantegazzianum. Only the distribution of I. glandulifera revealed significant spatial autocorrelation among hectads at the national scale. These patterns appear related to the different dispersal mechanisms of the three species. 5. The majority of the environmental variables identified as important at the tetrad resolution for County Durham were also important at the hectad resolution for England and Wales for both F. japonica and I. glandulifera, but not for H. mantegazzianum. However, for all three species the environmental variables identified as significant were consistent with qualitative descriptions of the species' habitat characteristics. There was no evidence of a hierarchy of environmental controls. 6. At the regional extent, scaling-up species' distributions from tetrads to hectads was relatively successful, but scaling-down was not. The coarser resolution models were too unrefined to model fine-scale distributions successfully. Similarly, at a coarse hectad resolution, regional models were poor predictors of national species' distributions. It therefore appears that scaling-up from fine to coarse resolution is appropriate when spatial extent is held constant, and focusing-down from large to small spatial extents is appropriate when data resolution is held constant.

AB  - 1. This paper examines the circumstances under which control programmes may reduce the range of two widespread invasive weeds of riparian habitats: Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam) and Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed). 2. The spread of both species was modelled using MIGRATE, a spatially explicit model that incorporates realistic demographic parameters and multiple dispersal mechanisms. Simulations of a range of control scenarios were run within a geographical information system (GIS) using authentic landscapes based on topographic, hydrological and land cover maps of County Durham, UK. Results were interpreted at both a catchment and a regional scale. 3. Six representative strategies were explored that prioritized control as follows: at random, in relation to human population density, or by the size, age (new and old) or spatial distribution of weed populations. These strategies were assessed at different intensities of management (area treated per year) and for varying efficiencies (proportion of plants destroyed) as well as the timeliness (how long since the species became established) of implementations. 4. Strategies that prioritized control based on weed population and spatial characteristics were most effective, with plant population size and spatial distribution being the key parameters. The reduction in geographical range within a catchment or region following control was always greater for H. mantegazzianum than I. glandulifera due to its slower rate of spread. 5. Successful control of both species at a regional scale is only possible for strategies based on species distribution data, undertaken at relatively high intensities and efficiencies. The importance of understanding the spatial structure of the population and potential habitat available, as well as being able to monitor the progress of the eradication programme, is highlighted. Tentative conclusions an offered as to the feasibility of eradicating these species at a regional scale.

TI  - Switzerland and the invasive plant species issue
AU  - Weber, E.
T2  - Botanica Helvetica
AB  - The increasing number of naturalized non-native plant species with a negative ecological impact on the communities where they grow (invasive species) is viewed as a major component of global change and is an important topic of current ecological research. In most regions of the world, the number of alien species is increasing as a result of trade, tourism, and disturbance, thus increasing the likelihood of plant invasions. Several international organizations have incorporated the invasive plant species issue in their main activities and have formulated guidelines for the management and eradication of invasive species. Switzerland as a central European country does not have as many invasive species as for example countries of other continents; however, some species are regarded as being invasive and are of special concern due to the highly fragmented and intensively used landscape. With the exceptions of the Alps, wildlife and areas of high conservation value are restricted to usually small areas, surrounded by heavily disturbed habitats or urban areas. In such places, invasive plant species may pose additional threats to the native diversity. Species of high concern are for example the north American Robinia pseudoacacia, Solidago altissima, S. gigantea, and the Asian species Impatiens glandulifera and Reynoutria japonica. In this article, the invasive species issue is highlighted with regard to the Swiss flora, and the needs for actions are discussed.

AU  - Titze, A.
T2  - Nordic Journal of Botany
AB  - To comprehend the reproductional success of Impatiens glandulifera in Central Europe, the pollination system was analyzed under field conditions. Impatiens glandulifera attracts a lot of visitors because of its abundant amount of nectar with its high sugar content. The range of visitors, their composition and their changes during the blooming time and their pollen loading capacity were investigated as well as plant and flower morphology, the nectar production, the quantity and viability of pollen, the stigmatic pollen load, the pollen/ovule ratio and the seed production of the neophyte. The visitors, which in Central Europe almost exclusively utilize the nectar, are passively covered with pollen because of the morphology and the mobile suspension of the flowers. Consequently the next landing results in a pollination of I. glandulifera during the female blooming phase. Although the germination rate of the pollen deposited on the stigma is very low, a 100% seed set is readily obtained during the initial visit to a flower in female stage.

AB  - Tolerance of desiccation in seeds is a multifactorial trait in which the synthesis of protective substances and the repression of degradative processes that are induced during dehydration are equally critical. The most documented degradative reaction linked with desiccation sensitivity in seeds is the accumulation of peroxidative damage following drying. Such oxidative stress is Likely to originate from reactive O(2) species (ROS) that are generated as a result of uncontrolled respiration and impaired electron flow in mitochondria. Under physiological conditions, the generation of ROS depends on the redox states of the electron-transfer components and the availability of ADP and O(2). However, it is not known whether these metabolic conditions prevail in drying seed tissues. Therefore this study focuses on the significance for energy metabolism of the changes in physical properties of water during drying. The effects of the loss of water on the redox states of cytochromes and energy metabolism during drying of imbibed cowpea cotyledons and pollens of Typha latifolia and Impatiens glandulifera were assessed non-invasively. Using electron spin resonance spectroscopy, it was found that viscosity is a valuable parameter to characterize the relation between desiccation and decrease in respiration and energy metabolism. During drying, mitochondrial cytochromes are progressively and synchronously reduced in conjunction with a decline in energy charge. The reduction of mitochondrial cytochromes probably originates from a decreased O(2) availability as a result of the increased viscosity and impeded diffusion. The metabolism in desiccation-intolerant tissues shifted partially to ethanolic fermentation during drying, indicating that they experience anoxia during drying. Such metabolic perturbations were absent in desiccation-tolerant tissues. Thus a regulated viscosity increase and controlled O(2) diffusion may be regarded as mechanisms of desiccation tolerance.

AB  - The national distribution of Fallopia japonica (Japanese Knotweed), Heracleum mantegazzianum (Giant Hogweed) and Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan Balsam) in bankside habitats is given for 1994-96 in the U.K. and contrasted with the occurrence of large stands of other nuisance plants. The typical habitats of these plants were derived by analysis of flow, channel and bank substrates from River Habitat Surveys and shows their invasion potential across the U.K. Study of the dispersal mechanisms and control techniques shows: (a) the consequences of accidental introductions to river banks from locations away from the river, (b) their further dispersal by the downstream drift of seed or fragments with their subsequent invasion, and (c) the key areas in the development of appropriate control programmes. The concentration of effort to immediate action and to small areas, especially upstream, is recommended, in preference to widespread but incomplete control.

TI  - The responses of cytochrome redox state and energy metabolism to dehydration support a role for cytoplasmic viscosity in desiccation tolerance
AU  - Leprince, O.

T2  - Plant Physiology
AB  - To characterize the depression of metabolism in anhydrobiotes, the redox state of cytochromes and energy metabolism were studied during dehydration of soaked cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) cotyledons and pollens of Typha latifolia and Impatiens glandulifera. Between water contents (WC) of 1.0 and 0.6 g H2O/g dry weight (g/g), viscosity as measured by electron spin resonance spectroscopy increased from 0.15 to 0.27 poise. This initial water loss was accompanied by a 50% decrease in respiration rates, whereas the adenylate energy charge remained constant at 0.8, and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) remained fully oxidized. From WC of 0.6 to 0.2 g/g, viscosity increased exponentially. The adenylate energy charge declined to 0.4 in seeds and 0.2 in pollen, whereas COX became progressively reduced. At WC of less than 0.2 g/g, COX remained fully reduced, whereas respiration ceased. When dried under N-2, COX remained 63% reduced in cotyledons until WC was 0.7 g/g and was fully reduced at 0.2 g/g. During drying under pure O-2, the pattern of COX reduction was similar to that of air-dried tissues, although the maximum reduction was 70% in dried tissues. Thus, at WC of less than 0.6 g/g, the reduction of COX probably originates from a decreased O-2 availability as a result of the increased viscosity and impeded diffusion. We suggest that viscosity is a valuable parameter to characterize the relation between desiccation and decrease in metabolism. The implications for desiccation tolerance are discussed.

T2  - Northwest Science
AB  - Nonnative plant species continue to be introduced into North America both accidentally and intentionally for horticultural and agricultural purposes. Some new species will spread extensively and some will become weeds of importance. We used a floristic database (INVADERS) to examine the status of incipient plant invasions in the northwest United States (Washington, Oregon, Idaho. Montana and Wyoming). We queried INVADERS for distribution records elf plant species exotic to North America that were first recorded in the northwest states during 1950-1996. The query resulted in records for 288 species, of which 133 were judged to have become established (based on collector notes), or to have high potential to spread beyond artificial environments such as lawns and gardens. Inherent potential for invasion was based on examination of several invasive plant lists and the international literature on plant invasions. Thirty species have become moderately widespread (reported from >5 counties) in the five-state northwest region, and several are known to be aggressive invaders in other regions of North America or in other parts of the world. Five species discussed in the text are notable for rapid spread and/or indications of aggressiveness: Polygonum cuspidatum (syn: Fallopia japonica, Reynoutria japonica), Bryonia alba, Impatiens glandulifera, Hieracium pratense and Scorzonera laciniata. Compared with the early exotics (mid 1800s - early 1900s), which tended to be annual herbs, the post-1950 exotic flora shows a trend reward greater proportions of perennials and woody growth forms (shrubs and trees). Some applications of floristic databanks in regional-scale management of plant invasions are discussed.

AB  - Nine bumblebee (Bombus)-species (listed) were determined to visit flowers of an exotic invasive species, Impatiens glandulifera Royle in the wetland biocorridors in the Czech Republic. None of the species was found specific to the target plant and the dominant part of the guild represented common eurytopic species. I. glandulifera was classified as an important source of nectar and pollen, and the significance of this source increased with the decreasing season as the bloom period lasted much longer than that bf most of the native plant species. Despite its invasive effects on the native plant communities in wetlands, I. glandulifera contributed to the conservation of common bumble-bee species, as well as to an over-all positive role of wetlands in the cultivated landscape.

AB  - In Germany, the attitude towards non-native plant species is ambiguous. Some are included in Red Data Books if declining, whereas others are controlled if suspected to cause damage. The public debate is often emotionally biased and there is no consensus on the relevance of plant invasions as threats to biological diversity or as sources of other conflicts. This paper presents the results of an inquiry among local authorities, started in 1995 in Niedersachsen (northern Germany). Firstly, this project aimed to provide a comprehensive picture of the perception of problematic plant invasions by public authorities (nature conservation, forestry, water management, coastal protection, urban green) and NGOs related to nature conservation, Secondly, the human response to invasive species was analysed. The main results are: A majority (72%) of 350 replies confirmed invasion conflicts in the area of personal responsibility of the addressee (greater than or equal to 80% in forestry, nature conservation and coastal protection compared to 41% in urban green and 60% in water management departments). In 55% of 592 specified cases vegetation changes were named as an unwanted invasion effect. Only 7% of these cases involved endangered plant species. A quarter of all conflicts (27%) were related to economic problems: 5% affected the maintenance of watercourses, 22% forest management (mainly the recruitment of native trees). Invasion problems were attributed to 31 non-native species, bur >80% of all problematic invasion events were related to (in decreasing importance) Prunus serotina, Helacleum mantegazzianum, Reynoutria (incl, R. japonica, R. sachalinensis, R. x bohemica), Impatiens glandulifera, Elodea (incl. E, canadensis, E. nuttallii), Vaccinium corymbosum x angustifolium. Half of all invasion events (49%) classified as problematical were subject to control. The majority of control activities were ineffective: In only 23% was control evaluated as successful, The majority of all respondents expressed a need for control of plant invasions. In detail, 38% voted for a response in single cases, 29% for a generally high priority for future control, Only 14% expressed no need for control. The results show that a single case approach is adequate for assessing plant invasions in central Europe.

AB  - In many European countries Himalayan Balsam Impatiens glandulifera has become increasingly common, both in ruderal and in seminatural or even natural habitats. The rate of expansion of this neophyte in Poland seems to be less than for example in the Czech Republic, but in fact there are no data on the actual number of its localities in our country. Also very poor are data on the types of plant communities with this species. I, glandulifera was recorded from both the sources and the mouth of the Odra river, bur until the early 70s there were no records from the mid section of the Odra valley. In 3-years we Found almost 20 new localities along a 30 km section of the Odra valley (between the town of Olawa and Wroclaw) and many more in ruderal habitats near villages. I. glandulifera competes there with both native and other alien plant species like I. parviflora or Solidago gigantea. Some individuals of I. glandulifera were noted in such annual and perennial plant communities (according to Braun-Blanquet school) as: Polygono-Bidentetum, Calystegio-Archangelicetum litoralis, Cuscuto-Convolvuletum, Phalariditum arundinacene and Urtico-Calystegietum. It was found also in riverside, periodically flooded forests of Alno-Padion, but the biggest and thickest stands of I. glandulifera were classified as Impatienti-Calystegietum (Moor 1958) Soo 1971, which prefers semi-shaded forest edges, nor far from the river.

AB  - Examination of the patterns of early growth and mortality in the alien Impatiens glandulifera may yield clues to the control of the further spread of this plant by community constraint. Seedlings in wild populations of Impatiens glandulifera were individually tagged and mortality recorded. High mortality rates were found which varied according to habitat and locally competing species. Major causes of mortality at the seedling stage were identified as slug predation, disease and (under tree canopies) physical damage from rainfall. Highest mortality rates occurred during the period between mid-May and the beginning of July.

AU  - Douglas, A. E.
T2  - Entomologia Experimentalis Et Applicata
AB  - Twenty-nine clones of Aphis fabae Scopoli (Aphididae: Homoptera) were isolated into laboratory culture from the primary host plants Euonymus europaeus and Viburnum opulus and the secondary host plants Arctium lappus, Impatiens glandulifera, Tropaeolum majus and Vicia faba. All clones performed well on either T. majus or V. faba, with mean intrinsic rates of increase (r(m)) in the range 0.35-0.41 aphids aphid(-1) day(-1), but none performed well on both plant species. Each clone could, therefore, be described as affiliated to either V. faba or T. majus. All of the 13 T. majus-affiliated clones and 15 of the 16 V. faba-affiliated clones could not be maintained beyond two parthenogenetic generations on the contrary plant. These results confirm that the performance of A. fabae on ?: majus and V. faba is negatively correlated. Exceptionally, one V. faba-affiliated clone (clone AED95/119) persisted indefinitely on T. majus, exhibiting a progressive improvement in performance across four parthenogenetic generations: larval mortality dropped from 80% to <20%, mean adult weight almost doubled from 0.28 to 0.53 mg, and mean number of embryos per adult aphid increased threefold from 8.6 to 24.4 embryos. The mean r(m) of clone AED95/119 that had been reared on ?: majus for more than 4 generations was 0.17 aphids aphid(-1) day(-1), significantly lower than the value of 0.34 aphids aphid(-1) day(-1) on V. faba. it was also shown that the r(m) on V. faba did not differ significantly between aphids of clone AED95/119 that had been derived from long-term cultures on V. faba and T. majus. It is concluded that the negative correlation between performance on V. faba and T. majus is not genetically fixed, but may diminish with exposure to T. majus. The implication is that this clone may have a capacity to utilise T. majus that is independent of its capacity to utilise V. faba, and is expressed only on sustained exposure to T. majus. It is suggested that, although the 'latent' capacity to utilise T. majus is probably not exhibited widely under natural conditions, aphids possessing it may be at a selective advantage when more suitable host plants are temporarily unavailable.

AB  - The invasion of Impatiens glandulifera in the territory of the Czech Republic, Central Europe, was reconstructed on the basis of floristic records. The first spontaneous occurrences were reported from the end of the 19th century. The exponential phase of invasion started in the 1930s and the highest increase in the cumulative number of localities reported occurred in the 1960s. Since its introduction, I. glandulifera has spread into 47.4% of available mapping squares. The species is closely confined to riparian habitats. At present it occupies 56% of the length of larger river systems. It is predicted that it will occur in all larger rivers in the Czech Republic by c. 2025, assuming that the rate of invasion remains constant. The rates of invasion in the Czech Republic, British Isles, Bavaria (Germany), and Slovakia are compared. In all the countries considered, the greatest increase occurred in recent decades, and was related to the date of escape from cultivation. Although the situation in the Czech Republic is at present not critical, the ability of I. glandulifera to outcompete native flora, and its predicted expansion along water courses, indicates that it could become a more serious threat to nature conservation in the future.

AU  - PYSEK, P.

T2  - Journal of Biogeography
AB  - We compared the rate of invasion of four plant species which are alien to central Europe and the highest-growing representatives of different life-forms: Impatiens glandulifera (annual), Heracleum mantegazzianum (monocarpic perennial), Reynoutria japonica and R. sachalinensis (polycarpic perennials). The spread of these species in the Czech Republic was reconstructed on the basis of floristic data. Cumulative numbers of localities reported from the time of introduction to the present were used for comparison. Exponential regression models were found to best fit the increase in the cumulative number of localities over time and the slope b was considered a convenient measure of the invasion rate. The ranking of species according to the decreasing rate of invasion was: I. glandulifera, Reynoutria japonica, Heracleum mantegazzianum, R. sachalinensis. The rate of invasion in riparian habitats, if these were treated separately, decreased in the following order: I. glandulifera, R. sachalinensis, R. japonica, H. mantegazzianum. The lag and exponential phases of spread were distinguished and the timing of the beginning of invasion was estimated at 1936 in I. glandulifera, 1938 in R. japonica, 1943 in H. mantegazzianum and 1952 in R. sachalinensis. H. mantegazzianum and I. glandulifera began to spread exponentially after having reached only a few localities in the area studied and their invasion rates during the exponential phase were higher than those of both Reynoutria species, whose invasion proceeded at a more even rate. Habitat preferences differed between species in both lag and exponential phases of spread. Different patterns of affinity to riparian habitats were found among the species studied. The role of river corridors in encouraging plant invasions is discussed on the regional scale with respect to the autecology of the species and frequency of suitable habitats.

AB  - The rate and extent of spread of three introduced species of Impatiens (I. glandulifera Royle, I. parviflora DC and I. capensis Meerburgh) in Britain was studied. The dates for the first records in each vice-county were obtained, and used to estimate rates of spread in England since their introduction. I. glandulifera was estimated as having a rate of spread of up to 38 km yr1, compared to a rate of up to 24 km yr1 for I. parviflora. The use of vice-county data as opposed to 10 km squares is discussed. Comparative growth experiments were performed both in garden plots and in the field, in an attempt to identify characters which enabled I. glandulifera to be so successful. Frost tolerance and seed output seem to be important factors; there are no doubt others not identified. Occasional long distance dispersal events, probably aided by man, are considered to be responsible for the rapid spread of I. glandulifera. Impatiens glandulifera is a pest plant because it forms dense monospecific stands in damp woodland, swamping all other plants. It is able to do so because of early germination and rapid growth to a height higher than any other British annual. Local spread is limited to 2 m yr1 from its own ballistic dispersal and to a small multiple of that from animal spread.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE NORTHERN DISTRIBUTION-LIMITS OF THE INTRODUCED SPECIES FALLOPIA-JAPONICA AND IMPATIENS-GLANDULIFERA IN NORTH-WEST EUROPE
AU  - BEERLING, DJ
T2  - Journal of Biogeography
AB  - This paper tests the predictions of sensitivity analysis performed on two matrix population growth models, for annual and perennial vegetation (Woodward, 1988). Climatic correlations have been established for two introduced invasive plant species Fallopia japonica (Japanese knotweed) and Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam) in north-west Europe. These two species represent examples of perennial and annual vegetation respectively. In accordance with the model predictions, the northern distribution limit of F. japonica was found to be controlled by two climatic variables-the length of the growing season, measured in day-degrees, and the minimum temperature-while for I. glandulifera only the length of the growing season was critical. Experimental verification of the results is crucial for understanding the mechanisms operating to limit plant distributions. By use of the predictions established by the climatic correlations for I. glandulifera and F. japonica, maps have been produced forecasting the potential northward spread of both species on the basis of a 1.5-degrees-C and a 4.5-degrees-C rise in global mean surface air-temperature. These temperatures represent the minimum and maximum increases predicted to occur by general circulation models for a doubling of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. For a global temperature increase of 1.5-degrees-C the maps demonstrate a maximum northward spread of F. japonica from a latitude of 63-degrees to 68-degrees-N and for I. glandulifera from 64-degrees up to 69-degrees-N. The greater temperature increase of 4.5-degrees-C indicates a considerable potential for expansion in the range of F. japonica in Norway and Sweden but a distribution which was restricted along the eastern coast of Sweden and southern Finland. In contrast, I. glandulifera could colonize the whole of the Fennoscandinavian area. The predictions are made assuming no migrational lag and no soil 'incompatibility'. Geographical differences in the patterns of spread between the species were explained with reference to the different factors affecting perennial and annual vegetation.

T2  - Journal of Experimental Botany
AB  - The anchorage systems of Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera and mature sunflowers Helianthus annuus were investigated by combining morphological and anatomical study of the root systems with mechanical tests on roots and with studies in which mature plants were pulled over. The root system of balsam is dominated by large numbers of fleshy tapering adventitious roots which point downwards from their origin at the wide stem base. Sunflowers, in contrast, have a tapering tap-root from which 20-30 well-branched laterals emerge, pointing radially outwards and downwards. Roots of each species have contrasting anatomy: those of balsam resemble stems, having a central watery pith and being strengthened peripherally by lignification of vascular tissue; roots of sunflowers are strengthened by a solid woody stele. Roots of both species are rigid in tension and, towards the base, in bending. Both species exhibited similar behaviour to that known for trees such as Sitka spruce; when pulled over they rotated about a hinge leeward of the stem base and a root-soil ball was pulled out of the surrounding soil. Anchorage was resolved into three components which, in order of decreasing magnitude, were (i) the resistance to pulling of the roots on the windward side of the plant (and, for sunflower, the tap-root); (ii) the resistance of roots and soil at the leeward hinge to rotation; and (iii) the weight of the root-soil ball. Sunflower had stronger anchorage but achieved it at a greater cost in terms of the dry mass of its root system. In each species, the morphology, anatomy and mechanical properties of the root system can be related to those of the stem. The wide stem base of balsam allows large numbers of mechanically efficient fleshy roots to be attached whereas in sunflowers a woody tap-root system is necessary to anchor the much narrower stem.

AU  - BURQUEZ, A.
AU  - CORBET, SA
T2  - Functional Ecology
AB  - The rate of change in the standing crop of nectar allowed to accumulate in flowers, described here as the apparent secretion rate, can be resolved into two components: gross secretion rate and apparent reabsorption rate. A simple model shows how changes in these component rates may affect the apparent secretion rate. The ecological and physiological correlates of various temporal patterns of secretion are discussed in relation to whether the nectar carbohydrates originate from storage tissues or from immediate photosynthate. Experiments with Impatiens glandulifera Royle, Borago officinalis L. and Fritillaria imperialis L. gave no evidence for reabsorption, but in Brassica napus L. apparent reabsorption was revealed by a difference between the apparent secretion rate and the cumulative rate of secretion derived by repeated sampling of individual flowers at short intervals, and true absorption was revealed by net solute loss from flowers protected from insect visits. Gross secretion rate and apparent reabsorption rate both peaked at midday on day 1. Thereafter secretion almost stopped, but reabsorption continued, peaking at night and at midday on day 2, until no more nectar remained in the flowers. Reabsorption occurs in some species but not in others. We suggest that it does not occur in flowers in which nectar accumulates at a site remote from the nectary (e.g. Asclepiadaceae), or in those in which the nectar is lost when the corolla falls (e.g. Impatients). The ecological implications of reabsorption are considered briefly.
