TI Chitosan delays ripening and ROS production in guava (Psidium guajava
   L.) fruit
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB Guava is a typically tropical fruit highly perishable with a short shelf-life due to intense metabolic activity after harvested. In attempt to minimize the problems related to the postharvest, we evaluated the physiochemical characteristics and antioxidant system in guava fruits under chitosan coating at concentrations of 1%, 2%, and 3% stored at 25 degrees C during 96 h. The chitosan suppressed the respiratory rate, fresh weight loss, firmness and skin color with delay in the degradation of chlorophyll. In the treatment with 2% and 3% of chitosan in the solid soluble content and ascorbic acid were reduced; retarded the loss of titratable acidity during 96 h after treatment. These treatment induced significant decreases in the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity and significantly increases of peroxidase Activity. Our results suggest that chitosan effectively prolongs the quality attributes in guava fruits after harvesting due to increases in the antioxidant processes, delaying the ripening during room temperature of storage.

TI Preparation and characterisation of poly(vinyl) alcohol (PVA)/starch
   (ST)/halloysite nanotube (HNT) nanocomposite films as renewable
   materials
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Poly(vinyl) alcohol (PVA)/starch (ST) films (weight ratio: 80/20) were prepared using a solution casting method, in the presence of 30 wt% glycerol (GL) as a plasticiser. Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) were used as relatively new clay nanofillers to PVA/ST/GL blends for more economical material packaging. HNTs at filler loadings of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3 and 5 wt% were incorporated to enhance mechanical and thermal properties of resulting PVA/ST/HNT nanocomposites. The tensile strength of such nanocomposites was found to be improved by 20 and 3.4%, respectively, with the inclusion of 0.25 and 0.5 wt% HNTs as opposed to those of PVA/ST/GL blends. However, a decreasing strength trend was observed beyond the HNT loading of 0.5 wt% due to HNT agglomeration, as evidenced by relevant micrographs via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). However, Young's modulus was enhanced by 148% with the addition of 1 wt% HNTs when compared with PVA/ST/GL blends. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis is indicative of slightly intercalated nanocomposite structures formed at low HNT loadings of 0.25-1 wt%. In general, the incorporation of HNTs improved the thermal stability of PVA/ST/GL blends by increasing melting and decomposition temperatures along with the reduction in weight loss.

TI Application of enzyme-hydrolyzed cassava dregs as a carbon source in
   aquaculture
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB As a kind of tropical agricultural solid waste, cassava dregs had become a thorny nonpoint source pollution problem. This study investigated the feasibility of applying cassava dregs as a substitute for sucrose in biofloc technology (BFT) systems. Three types of biofloc systems (using three different carbon sources sucrose (BFT1), cassava dregs (BFT2) and enzyme-hydrolyzed cassava dregs (BFT3) respectively), and the control were constructed in this experiment in 200 L tanks with a C/N ratio of 20/1. The comparison of the water quality indicators (The total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrite (NO2--N), nitrate (NO3--N), chemical oxygen demand (COD)), biofloc for the above four groups was performed, and the results indicated that BFT3 showed greater potential to the formation of biofloc, which was beneficial for the water quality control. So the shrimp survival rate was the highest and the feed conversion rate was the lowest in BFT3. Besides, the high-throughput sequencing results showed that the relative abundance of heterotrophic bacteria in the top 30 dominant microbial communities in BFT3 was higher than those in BFT1 and BFT2 by 20.70% and 1.19%, respectively, which could decrease TAN to improve the water quality. Overall, the results had proved that the cassava dregs of enzymes hydrolysis could be used as an ideal and cheap carbon source in BFT. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Light-activated antimicrobial activity of turmeric residue edible
   coatings against cross-contamination of Listeria innocua on sausages
SO FOOD CONTROL
AB The high number of foodborne outbreaks in ready-to-eat (RTE) food such as cooked sausages illustrate the importance of controlling microbial safety during post-processing stages of food products. Edible antimicrobial coatings can be applied to food after processing and sanitation with the goal of preventing microbial cross-contamination, decreasing the risk of foodborne illness and increasing the product shelf life. In this study, edible hydrogel coatings that can present strong antimicrobial activity when combined with UV-A light were prepared. The hydrogels coatings were prepared using either turmeric residue and gelatin hydrogels (TGH) or cassava starch and gelatin hydrogels with added purified curcumin (CGH). The coatings were characterized regarding their thickness, encapsulated curcumin concentration and water swelling, in addition to their light-activated antimicrobial activity against different initial loads of Listeria innocua at different incubation temperature. Additionally, the coatings were applied to the surface of cooked sausages and evaluated for their ability to prevent bacterial cross-contamination. It was observed that UV-A light-exposed hydrogels coatings could inactivate more than 5 log CFU/mL of L innocua after light treatments as short as 5 min. In addition, the light-activated antimicrobial activity of the hydrogel coatings were not affected by the incubation temperature. Hydrogel-coated sausages exposed to UV-A light experienced a reduction from 4 log CFU/mL of incubated bacteria to levels below the detection limit of 1 log CFU/mL after 5 and 15 min of light exposure, for CGH and TGH, respectively. Further mechanistic studies suggested that L innocua inactivation was due to the photo-irradiation of low levels of curcumin released from the coatings to solution. Lastly, it was shown that the combination of curcumin-loaded hydrogels coatings and UV-A light have great potential as antimicrobial coatings to prevent cross-contamination of L. innocua in refrigerated sausages.

TI Prevalence of Fusarium mycotoxins in cassava and yam products from some
   selected Nigerian markets
SO FOOD CONTROL
AB Fusarium mycotoxins were determined by a multi-mycotoxin liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method in cassava (garri and lafun) and yam (amala) products collected from some selected Nigerian markets. Of the 94 samples analysed, 71% were contaminated with at least one mycotoxin at an incidence rate of 54% (garri), 72% (lafun), and 82% (amala). Deoxynivalenol which ranged between 35 and 99 mu g/kg was the most prevalent Fusarium mycotoxin in garri with an incidence rate of 38%, while the dominant mycotoxin in lafun (61%, range = 30-392 mu g/kg) and amala (68%, range = 29 -155 mu g/kg) was fumonisin By. Other mycotoxins detected from the food products included fumonisin B-1 and B-3, zearalenone, 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside, T-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol, and fusarenon-X. The consumption of these contaminated products may be a possible route of exposure to a cocktail of Fusarium mycotoxins and can cause potential synergistic health effects on the Nigerian population.

TI Thermoplastic cassava starch-chitosan bilayer films containing essential
   oils
SO FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS
AB Starch-chitosan bilayer films, containing or not essential oils in the casted chitosan layer were obtained by thermo-compression. Bilayer films exhibited a good interfacial adhesion and better mechanical resistance than starch monolayers, although they were less stretchable and less transparent. Starchchitosan films were effective at controlling the bacterial growth in pork meat, but the thermal treatment applied to obtain the bilayers reduced their antimicrobial properties as compared to chitosan monolayers. The addition of essential oils did not promote any antimicrobial action in chitosan mono and bilayer films applied to pork meat. The final amount of essential oils in the films was very limited probably due to the losses occurred during film processing method. Other strategies to incorporate the essential oils into chitosan-based films should be used to improve their final retention in the film matrix and their effective release into the coated food.

TI The effect of amylose content and level of oxidation on the structural
   changes of acetylated corn starch and generation of free radicals
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB This study was aimed at determining the effect of starch oxidation on its acetylation, structure of starch granules, and generation of free radicals. Corn and waxy corn starches were oxidised by NaClO applied in doses of 10, 20, and 30 g Cl/kg of starch, and then acetylated using acetic acid anhydride. The carboxyl, carbonyl, acetyl groups were determined in modified starches. Structural properties of starch granules were evaluated based on molecular weight distribution, gelatinisation, crystallinity, specific surface, intrinsic viscosity. EPR measurements were carried out to establish starch susceptibility to UV irradiation induced generation of free radicals. It was found that the number of carbon centered radicals was dependent on the kind of starch and its chemical modification. Study results allowed concluding that the applied modifications contributed to significant changes in starch granules that were determined not only by the amylose content of starch but also by the degree of its oxidation.

TI Synthesis and characterization of cassava starch with maleic acid
   derivatives by etherification reaction
SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB Cassava starch was grafted with three different esters by the etherification reaction and its modification was characterized by H-1 NMR, FTIR, DSC, SEM, XDR, contact angle and SLS. The samples grafted with diethyl maleate, dipropyl maleate, and dibutyl maleate showed DS values of 2.3, 1.0 and 2.0, respectively, determined from H-1 NMR analysis and confirmed by FTIR analysis, with the appearance of bands at 1721, 1550 and 1126 cm(-1). The FTIR, XRD, SEM and DSC results indicated a change in the intra and intermolecular hydrogen interactions in the grafted starch when compared to native starch. Based on the contact angles, it was observed that the macromolecular starch chain acquired hydrophobic characteristics through the substitution of the hydrogens with di maleate esters. The characteristics acquired by grafted starch allow it to be used for the encapsulation of bioactive molecules for the production of bioactive packages and the production of biodegradable packages.

TI Integrating compound-specific delta C-13 isotopes and fallout
   radionuclides to retrace land use type-specific net erosion rates in a
   small tropical catchment exposed to intense land use change
SO GEODERMA
AB Retracing net erosion rates linked to land use change in tropical agricultural catchments dominated by smallholder farmers is challenging, due largely to catchment heterogeneity and uncontrolled farming practices. To tackle this problem and to complement a preceding study (Brandt et al., 2016), we introduce here an advanced approach that integrates compound-specific delta C-13 isotopes (CSSI) and fallout radionuclides (FRN), Excess lead 210 (Pb-210(ex)) and Cesium-137 (Cs-137) to estimate past net erosion rates of dominant land use types in the mountainous catchment Chieng Khoi (207 ha, Northwest Vietnam). Spatially-integrated topsoil (0 to 2 cm) samples of dominant land use types (e.g., protected and secondary forests, teak, fruit orchards, maize, cassava) were collected from at least three discrete plots of each land use type within the upland area (i.e., erosion sites) of the studied catchment. In the corresponding lowland area, a representative sediment profile was localized and divided into sections of 2 to 4 cm for CSSI and FRN analysis. Samples for FRN reference data were taken from undisturbed areas in close proximity. At a soil deposition site near a lakeshore, Pb-210(ex) data determined the age and sediment accumulation rates of 19 sediment layers to a depth of 38 cm. Based on (210)Pbc(ex) activity, maximum sediment accumulation rates of 127 t ha(-1) y(-1) were calculated, corresponding to erosion rates of about 16 t ha(-1) y(-1) for the total catchment area. CSSI data confirmed that maize and cassava were the most important erosion sources during a period of dramatic land use change (1987 to 2004), when forests were cleared and high-yielding maize hybrids were introduced. Based on integrated FRN and CSSI data, net erosion rates of maize and cassava reached maximum rates of 4.8 t ha(-1) y(-1) (maize), 6.2 t ha(-1) y(-1) (cassava). This major finding verified the potential of integrating FRN and CSSI to accurately estimate land use type-specific net erosion rates. In conclusion, determining past sediment budgets for specific land use types provides insight into the accelerating impact of specific land use change on soil retrogression and degradation. Such knowledge is of prime importance for effective soil conservation through evidence-based land management and decision making.

TI Effects of nanosilica on retrogradation properties and structures of
   thermoplastic cassava starch
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB Composites of thermoplastic cassava starch (TPS) and nanosilica (SiO2) were prepared by the melting method. The effect of nano-SiO2 on the retrogradation properties and structures of cassava starch was investigated. The retrogradation degree of TPS/nano-SiO2 composites increased with increasing retrogradation time. The retrogradation rate of TPS significantly increased after the addition of nano-SiO2, but excessive nano-SiO2 content leads to a decrease in the retrogradation rate of TPS. According to the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results, the retrogradation degree of TPS/nano-SiO2 composites increased with the increase of retrogradation time and addition of nano-SiO2. Scanning electron microscopy analysis indicated that nano-SiO2 particles were uniformly and finely dispersed in the starch materials, but the nano-SiO2 particles aggregated in the cassava starch with a further increase in nano-SiO2 content. X-ray diffraction revealed that the crystalline structure of the starch was gradually altered from A-type to V-type with the increase of retrogradation time. TPS/SiO2 composites indicated a mixture of A+V types, and the intensity of the V-type strengthened with the increase of retrogradation time and SiO2 content. Polarized light microscopy analysis revealed clear Maltese cross patterns, and the number of spherulites in TPS/nano-SiO2 composites increased with increasing retrogradation time and nano-SiO2 content, but the retrogradation of starch was inhibited with further increases of nano-SiO2 content.

   hydrogel for drug delivery
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB Hydrolyzed collagen-grafted-poly[(acrylic acid)-co-(methacrylic acid)] hydrogels were synthesized by solution polymerization and confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. From sequential univariate analysis, the optimal molar ratio of acrylic acid: methacrylic acid was 92: 8 in the presence of N, N'-methylenebisacrylamide, ammonium persulfate, and N, N, N' N'-tetramethylethylenediamine at 0.12, 0.015, and 0.2% mol of the monomers, respectively. The water absorbency of this hydrogel was both pH-and temperaturedependent, but was higher in nonbuffered water than in boric acid/citric acid/phosphate buffer under the same conditions. The optimal hydrogel could swiftly swell and deswell in neutral and acid solutions, respectively. Its potential application in drug delivery was examined using insulin and methylene blue as model payload drugs. Loading in a 50% (v v(-1)) ethanol solution gave a higher insulin loading level than in the buffer water. Insulin and methylene blue were both released at pH 6.8 but not at pH 1.2, but followed first order kinetics and the Higuchi equation, respectively. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Evaluating carbon sequestration for conservation agriculture and tillage
   systems in Cambodia using the EPIC model
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration was evaluated for several long-term rain-fed cropping systems for conservation agriculture (CA) and conservation tillage (CT) in Cambodia using the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model. The mean crop yield, biomass and SOC stocks of four treatments and three replication in each primary cropping system (rice, soybean and cassava) were used for calibration and validation during the period 2009-2013. The CT and CA1 treatments were assigned to continuous cropping of primary crops. CA2 and CA3 treatments were assigned to rotated primary crops with maize. In all CA treatments, forage or legume cover crops were prior planted and intercropped with the primary crops to maintain full soil cover. The results show that EPIC successfully simulated crop yields, biomass, and SOC. However, the model tended to underestimate SOC in the CT treatments and overestimate SOC in the CA2 and CA3 treatments. Crop residue was found to highly influence SOC sequestration. Sediment loss in the CT treatments was found to be four times greater than CA treatments due to the CT tillage effects. The 20-year future simulations, using historical weather and automatically generated by EPIC, showed a decrease trend in SOC stocks in all CT treatments and an increase trend in most CA treatments, with the greatest increase for CA2 and CA3 treatments. Thus, the CA treatments in combination with the maize rotation were demonstrated to be more efficient to manage SOC sequestration over CA with one continuous primary crop.

TI On-farm diversity offsets environmental pressures in tropical
   agro-ecosystems: A synthetic review for cassava-based systems
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Ecosystem integrity is at risk across the tropics. In the quest to meet global dietary and market demands, tropical agro-ecosystems face unrelenting agricultural intensification and expansion. Agro-biodiversity can improve ecosystem stability and functioning, but its promotion in smallholder-based systems faces numerous practical hurdles. In the tropics, cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is cultivated on over 25 million hectares and features as the third most important source of calories. Cassava crops are often maintained by resource-poor farmers who operate on marginal lands, at the fringes of sensitive, biodiverse habitats. As traditional intercropping schemes are gradually abandoned, monoculture cassava systems face stagnating yields, resource-use inefficiencies and agro-ecosystem degradation. A global literature search identified 189 cassava intercropping studies, covering 330 separate instances of intercropping systems. We employed a vote-counting approach and simple comparative measure across a subset of 95 studies to document the extent to which intercropping sustains a bundle of ecosystem services. Across geographies and biophysical conditions, a broad range of intercrops provided largely positive effects on five key ecosystem services: pest suppression, disease control, land equivalency ratio (LER), and soil and water-related services. Ecosystem services were augmented through the addition of a diverse range of companion crops. Results indicated 25 positive impacts vs. 3 negative impacts with the addition of maize, 5 vs. 1 with gramineous crops, 23 vs. 3 with four species of grain legumes, and 9 vs. 0 with trees. Appropriate intercropping systems can help to strike a balance between farm-level productivity, crop resilience, and environmental health. Our work highlights an urgent need for interdisciplinary research and systems-level approaches to identify intensification scenarios in which crop productivity, provision of ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, and human well-being are all balanced.

AB Reducing both hunger and high expenditure on food imports is a priority for most developing African countries. Countries that hitherto have relied heavily on food imports are seeking new approaches to increase the utilization of locally grown crops. This review uses the case of cassava to propose that scientific and technological innovations, supported by public investment and appropriate policies, offer opportunities for better utilizing locally grown crops, encouraging agro-industrial development, reducing import expenditure, and providing much-needed income (bread) to smallholders.

TI Production, characterization and In vitro antioxidant activities of
   exopolysaccharide from Weissella cibaria GA44
SO LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Exopolysaccharide (EPS) producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strain GA44 isolated from gari (a Nigerian traditional fermented cassava mash) was identified with 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Weissella cibaria. The EPS produced mainly composed of glucose and rhamnose sugar units and its molecular mass was about 2.8 x 10(5) Da. The fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum analysis showed characteristics absorption peaks indicating the presence of -OH, C=O and C-H groups. Central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were used to study the interactive effect of the significant factors on EPS yield. Under optimum conditions, the predicted maximum EPS produced 4.88 g/L while the actual experimental value was 4.80 g/L. The in-vitro antioxidant activities of the EPS showed good scavenging effects on superoxide anion radical and hydroxyl radical. The characteristics of this EPS isolated from food source will be useful in food industries and could also serve as a potential antioxidant. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Comparison of gamma radiation effects on natural corn and potato
   starches and modified cassava starch
SO RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
AB The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of irradiation treatment on physicochemical properties of three natural polymers, i.e. native potato and corn starches and a typical Brazilian product, cassava starch modified through fermentation-sour cassava- and also to prepare composite hydrocolloid films based on them. Starches were irradiated in a Co-60 irradiation chamber in doses up to 15 kGy, dose rate about 1 kGy/h. Differences were found in granule size distribution upon irradiation, mainly for corn and cassava starch but radiation did not cause significant changes in granule morphology. The viscosity of the potato, corn and cassava starches hydrogels decreased as a function of absorbed dose. Comparing non-irradiated and irradiated starches, changes in the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra in the 2000-1500 cm(-1) region for potato and corn starches were observed but not for the cassava starch. Maximum rupture force of the starch-based films was affected differently for each starch type; color analysis showed that doses of 15 kGy promoted a slight rise in the parameter b* (yellow color) while the parameter L* (lightness) was not significantly affected; X-ray diffraction patterns remained almost unchanged by irradiation.

TI Bio-hythane production from cassava residue by two-stage fermentative
   process with recirculation
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB The two-stage hythane fermentation of cassava residue low in protein, rich in iron, and deficient in nickel and cobalt, resulted in failure after long-term operation, showing a radical decrease in methane production along with an increase in volatile fatty acids (VFAs) accumulation in the second stage. Based on the gap between theoretical demand and existing content of nutrients, the effect of their additions on hythane fermentation was validated in the repeated batch experiment and continuous experiment. The proliferation of hydrolysis bacteria, acidogens, and hydrogen producing bacteria and methanogens was guaranteed by sufficient N (0.7 g/L), S (30 mg/L), Ni (1.0 mg/L), and Co (1.0 mg/L), and the metabolism of a sustainable hythane fermentation was recovered. In this optimal nutrient combination of above trace elements, the highest hythane yield (426 m(3) hythane with 27.7% of hydrogen from 1 ton of cassava residue) was obtained.

TI Biorefinery integration of microalgae production into cassava processing
   industry: Potential and perspectives
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Cassava, the 5th most important staple crop, generates at least 600L of wastewater per ton of processed root. This residue, cassava processing wastewater (CPW) has a high chemical oxygen demand, that can reach 56 g/L, and has also high concentrations of several mineral nutrients. The cultivation of microalgae such as Chlorella, Spirulina and wild strains was evaluated in the last years in raw, minimally processed and partially digested CPW. Concentrations of 2-4 g/L of these microalgae, comparable to those obtained in synthetic media, could be reached. The BOD of the residue was reduced by up to 92%. This process can be integrated into cassava processing industries, if challenges such as the toxicity of the concentrated residue, bacterial contamination, and the isolation of robust strains are addressed. Because CPW carries about 11% of the crop energy, integrating biogas production and microalgal cultivation into the cassava processing chain is promising.

TI Effects of acid hydrolysis intensity on the properties of starch/xanthan
   mixtures
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB The effects of acid hydrolysis intensity on the physicochemical properties of starch/xanthan gum (XG) system were studied. Waxy corn starch (WCS) was subjected to different concentrations of hydrochloric acid, and crystallization and relative molecular weight analysis were performed. The results revealed that the starch granules became smaller during acid hydrolysis. X-ray diffraction pattern analysis showed that the crystal structure did not change with acid hydrolysis. Evaluation of the properties and digestibility of different acid-thinned starch/XG systems indicated that the viscosity of acid-thinned starch/XG decreased with increased acid hydrolysis intensity. Rheological property measurements indicated that the compound systems were a pseudo-plastic fluid, which is a typical weak gel structure. Finally, we show that the WCS1.0 M/XG has the highest stability of the tested mixtures. We conclude that adjusting the conditions of acid hydrolysis improves the stability and food quality-enhancing properties of starch. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Development and characterization of cassava starch films incorporated
   with blueberry pomace
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB This work is focused on the development of renewable and biodegradable films by the valorisation of wastes from food processing industries, with the aim of contributing to the development of more sustainable films. In this context, different contents of blueberry pomace (BP) were incorporated into cassava starch (CS) film forming solutions and the functional properties of the films prepared by solution casting were investigated, specifically, thermal, optical and physicochemical properties. BP-incorporated films showed good barrier properties against light, indicating their beneficial effect to prevent food deterioration caused by UV radiation when these films are used for food packaging applications. These results were related to the presence of aromatic compounds in BP, which can absorb light at wavelengths below 300 nm. Furthermore, all films maintained their structural integrity after immersion in water (24 h) and the maximum swelling displayed was lower than 300%. Additionally, the release of active compounds from BP into food simulants (after 10 days) showed higher migration into the acetic acid medium in comparison with the ethanol medium. Therefore, the incorporation of BP into CS film forming solution resulted in the improvement of film performance, suggesting the potential application of these films as active packaging.

TI RAV transcription factors are essential for disease resistance against
   cassava bacterial blight via activation of melatonin biosynthesis genes
SO JOURNAL OF PINEAL RESEARCH
AB With 1 AP2 domain and 1 B3 domain, 7 MeRAVs in apetala2/ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) gene family have been identified in cassava. However, the in vivo roles of these remain unknown. Gene expression assays showed that the transcripts of MeRAVs were commonly regulated after Xanthomonas axonopodis pv manihotis (Xam) and MeRAVs were specifically located in plant cell nuclei. Through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in cassava, we found that MeRAV1 and MeRAV2 are essential for plant disease resistance against cassava bacterial blight, as shown by the bacterial propagation of Xam in plant leaves. Through VIGS in cassava leaves and overexpression in cassava leave protoplasts, we found that MeRAV1 and MeRAV2 positively regulated melatonin biosynthesis genes and the endogenous melatonin level. Further investigation showed that MeRAV1 and MeRAV2 are direct transcriptional activators of 3 melatonin biosynthesis genes in cassava, as evidenced by chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR in cassava leaf protoplasts and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Moreover, cassava melatonin biosynthesis genes also positively regulated plant disease resistance. Taken together, this study identified MeRAV1 and MeRAV2 as common and upstream transcription factors of melatonin synthesis genes in cassava and revealed a model of MeRAV1 and MeRAV2-melatonin biosynthesis genes-melatonin level in plant disease resistance against cassava bacterial blight.

TI Designing coordination contract for biofuel supply chain in China
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB To ensure the sustainable supply of agricultural feedstock for biofuel production and improve the performance of biofuel supply chain, coordination along the biofuel supply chain in a random yield environment is studied. Three types of coordination contract are examined, namely, an over-production risk-sharing contract (OPC), an under-production risk-sharing contract (UPC), and a mixed contract (MC) with an asymmetric Nash bargaining model. Though an OPC and a UPC can correct the farmers' over-production and under-production behavior, the expected increase in profit may not be realized by the biofuel producer or the farmers. The MC is feasible because it achieves an efficient supply chain, where supply chain optimization as well as the interests of all individual actors are respected simultaneously. The proposed contracts are tested with data from the cassava-based biofuel industry in China. The findings help practitioners and policy makers understand when and how to implement coordination contracts to achieve the sustainable supply of agricultural feedstock for biofuel production and supply chain Pareto improvement as well.

TI Genotype by environment interactions in identifying cassava (Manihot
   esculenta Crantz) resistant to cassava brown streak disease
SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB Cassava landraces were evaluated for resistance to cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) for two cropping seasons at a disease hotspot area in Naliendele, Tanzania. Based on reactions to CBSD, several landraces including Chimaje, Mfaransa and Supa B were considered to be resistant to the disease while Kikwada, Mbuyu, and Nyoka were tolerant. ANOVA revealed that the largest sum of squares (SS) (41.9-86.7%) was attributed to the genotype of the cassava landraces, while a smaller proportion of SS (8.1-38.2%) was due to genotype by environment interactions for all traits tested, which included disease symptoms, root weight, number of roots per plant and dry matter content. Environment accounted for the smallest effect (0.01-26.3%), however, the mean squares was nonetheless significant for a few genotypes, which indicated that their disease expression was indeed influenced by the environment. Increased CBSD severity was associated with low temperatures and rainfall. Increased rainfall towards harvesting led to higher root weight but lower dry matter content in the first cropping season. Correlation analysis showed that the presence of CBSD symptoms reduces the amount of usable roots, total root weight, and root dry matter content. Many resistant/tolerant landraces also had high root weight and dry matter content, and they can be used by farmers to reduce CBSD losses. The landraces described here form novel sources of CBSD resistance that can be used for breeding disease-resistant cassava varieties with superior agronomic characteristics.

TI Quantifying trade-offs between future yield levels, food availability
   and forest and woodland conservation in Benin
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Meeting the dual objectives of food security and ecosystem protection is amajor challenge in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). To this end agricultural intensification is considered desirable, yet, there remain uncertainties regarding the impact of climate change on opportunities for agricultural intensification and the adequacy of intensification options given the rapid population growth. We quantify trade-offs between levels of yield gap closure, food availability and forest and woodland conservation under different scenarios. Each scenario is made up of a combination of variants of four parameters i.e. (1) climate change based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs); (2) population growth based on Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs); (3) cropland expansion with varying degrees of deforestation; and (4) different degrees of yield gap closure. We carry out these analyses for three major food crops, i.e. maize, cassava and yam, in Benin. Our analyses showthat in most of the scenarios, the required levels of yield gap closures required to maintain the current levels of food availability can be achieved by 2050 by maintaining the average rate of yield increases recorded over the past two and half decades in addition to the current cropping intensity. However, yields will have to increase at a faster rate than has been recorded over the past two and half decades in order to achieve the required levels of yield gap closures by 2100. Our analyses also show that without the stated levels of yield gap closure, the areas under maize, cassava and yam cultivation will have to increase by 95%, 102% and 250% respectively in order to maintain the current levels of per capita food availability. Our study shows that food security outcomes and forest and woodland conservation goals in Benin and likely the larger SSA region are inextricably linked together and require holistic management strategies that considers trade-offs and co-benefits.

TI Biodegradable baked foam made with chayotextle starch mixed with
   plantain flour and wood fiber
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB New renewable materials are needed to reduce petroleum-based plastic packaging. The effect of plantain flour (PF) and wood fiber (WF) on the properties of starch-based foams (SBFs) were investigated. The SBFs were characterized using physical, thermal, and mechanical methods to better understand the relationship between PF and WF concentration. Contact angle values showed that the addition of WF or PF increased the hydrophobic character of the SBFs. Also, the addition of PF increased the heat transfer resistance and density of the foams, while their solubility decreased. The values of tensile strength and Young's modulus increased with increasing concentrations of PF in the SBFs. However, the addition of PF and WF promoted a decrease on the elongation at break of the SBFs. An increase in concentration of PF also showed a decrease in water vapor permeability, and an increase in the thickness of the cell wall layer of the SBFs. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl.

TI Transcript profiling indicates a widespread role for bacterial-type
   phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase in malate-accumulating sink tissues
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is an important regulatory enzyme situated at a key branch point of central plant metabolism. Plant genomes encode several plant-type PEPC (PTPC) isozymes, along with a distantly related bacterial-type PEPC (BTPC). BTPC is expressed at high levels in developing castor oil seeds where it tightly interacts with co-expressed PTPC polypeptides to form unusual hetero-octameric Class-2 PEPC complexes that are desensitized to allosteric inhibition by L-malate. Analysis of RNA-Seq and microarray transcriptome datasets revealed two distinct patterns of tissue-specific BTPC expression in vascular plants. Species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, strawberry, rice, maize, and poplar mainly exhibited pollen-or floral-specific BTPC expression. By contrast, BTPC transcripts were relatively abundant in developing castor, cotton, and soybean seeds, cassava tubers, as well as immature tomato, cucumber, grape, and avocado fruit. Immunoreactive 118 kDa BTPC polypeptides were detected on immunoblots of cucumber and tomato fruit extracts. Co-immunoprecipitation established that as in castor, BTPCs physically interact with endogenous PTPCs to form Class-2 PEPC complexes in tomato and cucumber fruit. We hypothesize that Class-2 PEPCs simultaneously maintain rapid anaplerotic PEP carboxylation and respiratory CO2 refixation in diverse, biosynthetically active sinks that accumulate high malate levels.

SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB Plantain flour ( Musa ssp., group AAB, sub-group clone Harton)/ poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) blends, containing glycerol as a plasticizer, were prepared by reactive extrusion (REx) in a twin-screw extruder using zirconium octanoate (Zr(Oct)(4)) as a catalyst, followed by thermo-compression molding for film development. The films were then characterized in terms of their: infrared (FTIR) spectra, water solubility, thermogravimetric (TGA) curves, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms, and X-ray diffraction (XDR) diffractograms, as well as their microstructural, mechanical and antimicrobial properties in order to (1) compare the effects of PCLs with two different molecular weights (M-w) on the characteristics of the plantain flour/PCL blends, and (2) determine whether using Zr(Oct)(4) in the production of active composite polymer materials improves their properties. The plantain flour/PCL blends were all developed successfully. The higher Mw PCL gave more hydrophobic and thermally stable films with improved mechanical properties. The addition of the Zr(Oct)(4) catalyst to the plantain flour/PCL blends also resulted in films with similar characteristics to those described above, due to the cross-linking of the polymers. In addition, the films containing the catalyst showed antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli O157: H7 and Staphylococcus aureus indicating a dual effect of Zr(Oct)(4), and making it an attractive alternative for the development of active films.

TI Flavour production by Saprochaete and Geotrichum yeasts and their close

SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB In this study, a total of 30 yeast strains belonging to the genera Dipodascus, Galactomyces, Geotrichum, Magnusiomyces and Saprochaete were investigated for volatile organic compound production using HSSPME-GC/MS analysis. The resulting flavour profiles, including 36 esters and 6 alcohols compounds, were statistically evaluated by cluster and PCA analysis. Two main groups of strains were extracted from this analysis, namely a group with a low ability to produce flavour and a group producing mainly alcohols. Two other minor groups of strains including Saprochaete suaveolens, Geotrichum marinum and Saprochaete gigas were diverging significantly from the main groups precisely because they showed a good ability to produce a large diversity of esters. In particular, we found that the Saprochaete genus (and their closed relatives) was characterized by a high production of unsaturated esters arising from partial catabolism of branched chain amino-acids. These esters were produced by eight phylogenetically related strains of Saprochaete genus. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Starch content affects physicochemical properties of corn and cassava
   starch-based films
SO INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB Biodegradable starch-based film has been widely used as alternative to packaging derived from fossil sources. The composition, structural and morphological properties of starch granules vary with plant source, contributing to significant differences in properties and desired functionality. The objective of this work was to evaluate the starch content influence on physicochemical properties of corn (Zea mays L.) and cassava (Manihot esculenta L.) starch-based films manufactured by casting. Different starch contents (20-60 g kg(-1)), glycerol (9 g kg-1) and xanthan gum (0.05 g kg(-1)) were used. From Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis, it can be seen that corn and cassava native starches exhibited polyhedral and oval shape, respectively. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) results showed that higher biopolymer content promoted an increase in thickness (ranging between 0.07 and 0.17 mm) and a reduction in water vapor permeability (ranging between 0.42 and 0.15 g mm h(-1) M-2 kPa(-1)) of the starch-based films. Moreover, increased starch content in the films promoted improved mechanical properties. For the same starch content, cassava starch based films presented higher water solubility than corn films, approximately 22% and 16%, respectively. Mechanical properties of the starch (40 g kg(-1)) based films as tensile strength, (3.9 MPa), maximum elongation (120%) and elastic modulus (65 MPa) were comparable to LDPE (low density polyethylene) based films used as food packaging currently marketed. From the results obtained, corn and cassava starch may be considered promising alternatives for the food packaging development.

AB The development of biodegradable films with addition of natural antioxidants is an alternative to the use of non biodegradable packaging and use of synthetic antioxidants. The aim of this study was to develop biodegradable cassava starch films with antioxidant activity by the addition of free lycopene or lycopene nanocapsules and evaluate the effect of addition in the physical properties, mechanical and barrier of the films. Addition of free lycopene showed lower water vapor permeability, tensile strength and elongation of the films, however, the addition of lycopene nanocapsules provided an increase of these parameters compared to the control film. Addition of lycopene nanocapsules also provided greatest barrier to light transmission UV/Vis compared to the control films, films with added free lycopene and the commercial polyethylene film. The films incorporated lycopene nanocapsules provided greater protection to oxidation of stored sunflower oil under accelerated oxidation conditions, which shows potential application as packaging antioxidant to prevent oxidation of foods with a high fat content. The biodegradable films showed good thermal stability when subjected to different heating rates and rapid biodegradability for 15 days, which demonstrates good characteristics and potential applications of lycopene nanocapsules for the development of active biodegradable packaging.

TI Rapid analyses of dry matter content and carotenoids in fresh cassava
   roots using a portable visible and near infrared spectrometer (Vis/NIRS)
SO PLOS ONE
AB Portable Vis/NIRS are flexible tools for fast and unbiased analyses of constituents with minimal sample preparation. This study developed calibration models for dry matter content (DMC) and carotenoids in fresh cassava roots using a portable Vis/NIRS system. We examined the effects of eight data pre-treatment combinations on calibration models and assessed calibrations on processed and intact root samples. We compared Vis/NIRS derived-DMC to other phenotyping methods. The results of the study showed that the combination of standard normal variate and de-trend (SNVD) with first derivative calculated on two data points and no smoothing (SNVD+1111) was adequate for a robust model. Calibration performance was higher with processed than the intact root samples for all the traits although intact root models for some traits especially total carotenoid content (TCC) (R-c(2) = 96%, R-cv(2) = 90%, RPD = 3.6 and SECV = 0.63) were sufficient for screening purposes. Using three key quality traits as templates, we developed models with processed fresh root samples. Robust calibrations were established for DMC (R-c(2) = 99%, R-cv(2) = 95%, RPD = 4.5 and SECV = 0.9), TCC (R-c(2) = 99%, R-cv(2) (=) 91%, RPD = 3.5 and SECV = 2.1) and all Trans beta-carotene (ATBC) (R-c(2) = 98%, R-cv(2) = 91%, RPD = 3.5 and SECV = 1.6). Coefficient of determination on independent validation set (R-p(2)) for these traits were also satisfactory for ATBC (91%), TCC (88%) and DMC (80%). Compared to other methods, Vis/NIRS-derived DMC from both intact and processed roots had very high correlation (> 0.95) with the ideal oven-drying than from specific gravity method (0.49). There was equally a high correlation (0.94) between the intact and processed Vis/NIRS DMC. Therefore, the portable Vis/NIRS could be employed for the rapid analyses of DMC and quantification of carotenoids in cassava for nutritional and breeding purposes.

TI MeWRKY20 and its interacting and activating autophagy-related protein 8
   (MeATG8) regulate plant disease resistance in cassava
SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB As a highly conserved mechanism, autophagy is responsible for the transport of cytoplasmic constituents in the vacuoles or lysosomes. Moreover, autophagy is essential for plant development and various stress responses. In this study, 34 MeATGs were systematically identified in cassava, and their transcripts were commonly regulated by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv manihotis (Xam). Through transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, the subcellular locations of 4 MeATG8s were revealed. Notably, MeWRKY20 was identified as physical interacting protein of MeATG8a/8f/8h and upstream transcriptional activator of MeATG8a. Through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in cassava, we found that MeATG8-silenced and MeWRKY20-silenced plants resulted in disease sensitive, with less callose depositions and lower autophagic activity. This study may facilitate our understanding of the upstream MeWRKY20 and underlying target as well as interacting proteins of MeATG8s in immune response. Taken together, MeWRKY20 and MeATG8a/8f/8h are essential for disease resistance against bacterial blight by forming various transcriptional modules and interacting complex in cassava.

TI Two Cassava Basic Leucine Zipper (bZIP) Transcription Factors (MebZIP3
   and MebZIP5) Confer Disease Resistance against Cassava Bacterial Blight
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Basic domain-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, one type of conserved gene family, plays an important role in plant development and stress responses. Although 77 MebZIPs have been genome-wide identified in cassava, their in vivo roles remain unknown. In this study, we analyzed the expression pattern and the function of two MebZIPs (MebZIP3 and MebZIP5) in response to pathogen infection. Gene expression analysis indicated that MebZIP3 and MebZIP5 were commonly regulated by flg22, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis (Xam), salicylic acid (SA), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Subcellular localization analysis showed that MebZIP3 and MebZIP5 are specifically located in cell nucleus. Through overexpression in tobacco, we found that MebZIP3 and MebZIP5 conferred improved disease resistance against cassava bacterial blight, with more callose depositions. On the contrary, MebZIP3- and MebZIP5-silenced plants by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) showed disease sensitive phenotype, lower transcript levels of defense-related genes and less callose depositions. Taken together, this study highlights the positive role of MebZIP3 and MebZIP5 in disease resistance against cassava bacterial blight for further utilization in genetic improvement of cassava disease resistance.

TI Prediction of cassava protein interactome based on interolog method
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Cassava is a starchy root crop whose role in food security becomes more significant nowadays. Together with the industrial uses for versatile purposes, demand for cassava starch is continuously growing. However, in-depth study to uncover the mystery of cellular regulation, especially the interaction between proteins, is lacking. To reduce the knowledge gap in protein-protein interaction (PPI), genomescale PPI network of cassava was constructed using interolog-based method (MePPI-In, available at http://bml. sbi. kmutt. ac. th/ppi). The network was constructed from the information of seven template plants. The MePPI-In included 90,173 interactions from 7,209 proteins. At least, 39 percent of the total predictions were found with supports from gene/protein expression data, while further co-expression analysis yielded 16 highly promising PPIs. In addition, domain-domain interaction information was employed to increase reliability of the network and guide the search for more groups of promising PPIs. Moreover, the topology and functional content of MePPI-In was similar to the networks of Arabidopsis and rice. The potential contribution of MePPI-In for various applications, such as protein-complex formation and prediction of protein function, was discussed and exemplified. The insights provided by our MePPI-In would hopefully enable us to pursue precise trait improvement in cassava.

TI MicroRNA-like RNAs from the same miRNA precursors play a role in cassava
   chilling responses
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to play important roles in various cellular processes and stress responses. MiRNAs can be identified by analyzing reads from high-throughput deep sequencing. The reads realigned to miRNA precursors besides canonical miRNAs were initially considered as sequencing noise and ignored from further analysis. Here we reported a small-RNA species of phased and halfphased miRNA-like RNAs different from canonical miRNAs from cassava miRNA precursors detected under four distinct chilling conditions. They can form abundant multiple small RNAs arranged along precursors in a tandem and phased or half-phased fashion. Some of these miRNA-like RNAs were experimentally confirmed by re-amplification and re-sequencing, and have a similar qRT-PCR detection ratio as their cognate canonical miRNAs. The target genes of those phased and half-phased miRNAlike RNAs function in process of cell growth metabolism and play roles in protein kinase. Half-phased miR171d. 3 was confirmed to have cleavage activities on its target gene P-glycoprotein 11, a broad substrate efflux pump across cellular membranes, which is thought to provide protection for tropical cassava during sharp temperature decease. Our results showed that the RNAs from miRNA precursors are miRNA-like small RNAs that are viable negative gene regulators and may have potential functions in cassava chilling responses.

TI Accuracies of univariate and multivariate genomic prediction models in
   African cassava
SO GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION
AB Background: Genomic selection (GS) promises to accelerate genetic gain in plant breeding programs especially for crop species such as cassava that have long breeding cycles. Practically, to implement GS in cassava breeding, it is necessary to evaluate different GS models and to develop suitable models for an optimized breeding pipeline. In this paper, we compared (1) prediction accuracies from a single-trait (uT) and a multi-trait (MT) mixed model for a singleenvironment genetic evaluation (Scenario 1), and (2) accuracies from a compound symmetric multi-environment model (uE) parameterized as a univariate multi-kernel model to a multivariate (ME) multi-environment mixed model that accounts for genotype-by-environment interaction for multi-environment genetic evaluation (Scenario 2). For these analyses, we used 16 years of public cassava breeding data for six target cassava traits and a fivefold cross-validation scheme with 10-repeat cycles to assess model prediction accuracies.
   Results: In Scenario 1, the MT models had higher prediction accuracies than the uT models for all traits and locations analyzed, which amounted to on average a 40% improved prediction accuracy. For Scenario 2, we observed that the ME model had on average (across all locations and traits) a 12% improved prediction accuracy compared to the uE model.
   Conclusions: We recommend the use of multivariate mixed models (MT and ME) for cassava genetic evaluation. These models may be useful for other plant species.

TI STUDIES ON PHYSIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS AND APPLICABILITY OF CAROTENOID
   PIGMENT PRODUCTION FROM RHODOTORULA MUCILAGINOSA AS FOOD COLOURANT
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND STATISTICAL SCIENCES
AB The present investigation was carried out to identify efficient carotenoid pigment producing yeast (Rhodotorula mucilaginosa) by utilizing potential cheap natural substrates (Cassava bagasse) to minimize the production cost of pigments. The pigments were also studied for their stability in different conditions such as pH, heat, light, antioxidants and also in different oils. The results showed that highest pigment production was achieved with cassava bagasse and pigment solution having maximum stability at pH 7 than under acidic conditions. Addition of antioxidants to carotenoid pigment was found to increase the stability of the pigment to certain extent. Carotenoid pigment was found to be more stable in sunflower oil and sesame oil. The oil stability is more at 4 degrees C and also even at room temperature (RT) in some cases and very poor stability was observed at 60 degrees C. Carotenoid pigment was incorporated in the preparations of few food products like Indian milk ice cream, almond milk, ice cream, yoghurt and popcorn is pretty stable when stored in vegetable oils and it can be used in oil based food products as foods coloured with these pigments are more appealing.

TI Effect of molecular weight of starch on the properties of cassava starch
   microspheres prepared in aqueous two-phase system
SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB Starch microspheres (SMs) were fabricated in an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS). A series of starch samples with different molecular weight were prepared by acid hydrolysis, and the effect of molecular weight of starch on the fabrication of SMs were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the morphologies of SMs varied with starch molecular weight, and spherical SMs with sharp contours were obtained while using starch samples with weight-average molecular weight ((M) over barw) <= 1.057 x 10(5)g/mol. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results revealed that crystalline structure of SMs were different from that of native cassava starch, and the relative crystallinity of SMs increased with the molecular weight of starch decreasing. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results showed peak gelatinization temperature (T-p) and enthalpy of gelatinization (Delta H) of SMs increased with decreased (M) over barw of starch. Stability tests indicated that the SMs were stable under acid environment, but not stable under alpha-amylase hydrolysis.

TI Development of sensitive and specific real-time PCR systems for the
   detection of crustaceans in food
SO EUROPEAN FOOD RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Crustaceans are known allergens for a remarkable number of people. For the detection of traces of crustaceans in food, a specific and sensitive real-time PCR method was developed. An approximately 205 bp long fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene was chosen as molecular target region for the detection systems. The DNA sequence of this fragment was determined from 13 species belonging to different families and checked for homologies. Based on these data, primer-probe systems were developed for the economically relevant decapods within the class of Malacostraca belonging to the families Penaeidae, Palinuroidea, Astacoidea, Nephropoidea, Cancridae and Caridea. The specificity of the primer-probe systems was checked for inclusivity using DNA extracted from 17 different crustaceans. Exclusivity tests were carried out by analysing DNA samples derived from 21 mammals, six birds, 13 fishes, two molluscs and two insect species. Except for two systems, the molecular detection systems were optimised to be highly specific for the crustaceans. False positive signal was produced by DNA extracted from the hoverfly (Psilota rubra) in the system targeting the family Astacoidea and the common green lacewing (Chrysoperla carnea) in the systems targeting the family Astacoidea and Cancroidea. The LOD95% was close to the theoretical value of 2.96 copies per reaction. The sensitivity of the real-time PCR systems was determined using dilution series of crustacean DNA in rainbow trout DNA as animal matrix, and by artificial contamination of fish sticks and by artificial contamination of cassava chips with crustacean meat. The sensitivity ranging from 10 to 0.01 ppm is considered being appropriate for food analysis.

TI Responses of cassava growth and yield to leaf harvesting frequency and
   NPK fertilizer in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo
SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB Harvesting young cassava leaves as a vegetable is a common practice in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo). However, information on its effects on growth and yield of cassava is scarce. Multi-locational trials were conducted on farmers' fields in the province of South Kivu, DR Congo, during two consecutive years to investigate the effects of harvesting frequency of 3 young leaves (no leaf harvesting (NoH); leaf harvesting at 4 week intervals (4-WI) or 2 week intervals (2-WI), starting 4 months after planting) and fertilizer (with or without NPK application) on the growth and yields of cassava, comparable to common practice by farmers in the area, based on a preceding household survey. Overall, harvesting of leaves did not result in significant effects on both height and stem diameter compared with the unharvested treatment. However, collection of leaves at 2-WI significantly (P < 0.05) decreased both height and stem diameter, and resulted in significant (P < 0.1) reduction of stem yields of 20.9% (4.0 t ha(-1)) relative to leaf harvesting at 4-WI but only in the second year. Average total biomass and storage root yields in the control treatment were 35.8 and 23.5 t ha(-1), respectively and were not significantly affected by leaf harvesting. Application of NPK fertilizer resulted in significant (P < 0.05) increases of both height and stem diameter over time, independent of the frequency of leaf harvesting. Mineral fertilizer significantly (P < 0.05) increased the overall total, storage root and stem yields by 28.3% (9.5 t ha(-1)), 19.9% (4.5 t ha(-1)) and 45.1% (5.0 t ha(-1)), respectively regardless of the frequency of leaf harvesting. This study indicates that harvesting of young leaves results in small or negligible effects on cassava growth and yields compared to the mineral fertilizers which increase both cassava growth and yields in the conditions of our study.

TI Antimicrobial Effect of Edible Coating Blend Based on Turmeric Starch
   Residue and Gelatin Applied onto Fresh Frankfurter Sausage
SO FOOD AND BIOPROCESS TECHNOLOGY
AB The microbial and physicochemical properties of edible coating blend based on turmeric starch and bovine gelatin on frankfurter sausage were studied during the product's shelf life. Three edible films were prepared and their thermal, mechanical, and barrier properties evaluated one with turmeric starch (TF), one with gelatin (GF), and one with a blend of turmeric-starch and gelatin (BF). Physicochemical and bacteriostatic effects of the blend on the sausage were measured. Water vapor permeability (8.01 g day(-1) m(-2) atm(-1)) and tensile strength of the BF showed intermediate values (5 MPa) compared with results of the films containing turmeric (5.88 g day(-1) m(-2) atm(-1); 4 MPa) or gelatin (13.4 g d(-1) m(-2) atm(-1); 13 MPa) separately. Tensile strength was higher to GF (13 MPa), lower value (4 MPa) was obtained to TF, and intermediate value to BF (5 MPa). Elastic modulus was lower to BF (85 MPa) when compared to TF (126 MPa) and GF (271 MPa). Elongation at break of BF (42%) was higher among the three edible films (TF 7% and GF 36%). Emulsion stability measured by thermal analysis in DSC showed complete miscibility to BF, observed through melting point of polymers. The effect of the turmeric-gelatin blend coating on sausages stored at 5 and 10 A degrees C showed a significant (p >= 0.05) positive effect on decrease of microbial growth over 30 days. Physicochemical characteristics such as pH, texture profile, moisture, and color remained constant compared to control. Thus, the edible coating based on turmeric starch and gelatin blend is an alternative to replace the synthetic casing in frankfurter sausage.

SO FOOD CONTROL
AB The objective of the study was to investigate the identity, diversity, and safety of the Bacillus population involved in the fermentation of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) leaves for the production of Ntoba Mbodi, a Congolese food. Ninety bacteria were identified by phenotyping and genotyping using ITS-PCR, rep-PCR, and sequencing of the 16S rRNA, gyrA, gyrB and rpoB genes. Moreover, the isolates were screened for the presence of genes coding for haemolytic (HbIC, HbID) and non-haemolytic enterotoxins (NheA, NheB and NheC), cytotoxin K (CytK) and emetic toxin (EM1) as well as their ability to produce haemolysin.
   The investigations revealed the predominance (72.2%) of species of the Bacillus pumilus group i.e. B. safensis (48), B. pumilus (7), and B. pumilus sensu lato (10). Other species of Bacillus including B. cereus sensu lato (11), B. megaterium (4), B. subtilis (4), B. amyloliquefaciens (2), B. siamensis (2), B. licheniformis (1) and Lysinibacillus louembei (1) were also identified. Haemolytic, non-haemolytic and cytokin toxin genes were detected in the B. cereus strains which were also able to produce haemolysin. The emetic toxin gene was not detected in any isolates. The toxin genes screened were not detected in any of the non B. cereus species. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB The effect of heat treatment at 90, 100, 110 and 120? for 20min to sweet potato flour on dough properties and characteristics of sweet potato-wheat bread was investigated. The lightness (L*) and a* of sweet potato flour samples after heat treatment were increased, while the b* were decreased significantly, as well as the particle size, volume and area mean diameter (p<0.05). A slight change of the microstructures of sweet potato flour was observed, where the number of irregular granules increased as the temperature increased from 90 to 120?. Compared with sweet potato flour samples without heat treatment and with heat treatment at 90, 100 and 120?, the gelatinization temperature and enthalpy change of sweet potato flour at 110? were the lowest, which were 77.94? and 3.67J/g, respectively (p<0.05). After heat treatment, gas retention of the dough with sweet potato flour increased significantly from 1199ml without heat treatment to 1214ml at 90? (p<0.05). In addition, specific loaf volume of sweet potato-wheat bread with sweet potato flour after heat treatment increased significantly, which was the largest at 90? (2.53 cm(3)/g) (p<0.05). Thus, heat treatment at 90? to sweet potato flour could be potentially used in wheat bread production.

TI Estimating sugars in 212 landraces and hybrids of sweet type cassava
   (Manihot esculenta Crantz, Euphorbiaceae)
SO GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION
AB Sweet-type cultivars of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) are consumed boiled directly after harvest. Farmers are selecting landraces with various levels of sugars, and the characterisation of germplasm collections necessitates robust and accurate techniques for high-throughput analysis of numerous accessions. The objectives of the present study were to develop and test a high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) protocol for the fast quantitation of the cyanogenic glycoside linamarin and individual sugars (maltose, sucrose, glucose, fructose), to determine variation within and between roots and different clones of the same genotype, as well as to compare 147 landraces and 65 hybrids from Vanuatu for their total sugar contents. There is variation in total sugar content in the fresh root depending on where the sample is collected. A protocol based on the analysis of three samples per root (proximal, central and distal parts) was used to compare roots of the same plant and clones of the same accession. Overall, 1030 samples were analysed for major and unidentified minor sugars. For the 147 landraces, the minimum sugar content was 2.53 g (per cent fresh weight) and the maximum 10.36 g. Interestingly, selected hybrids presented a similar range of variation, from a minimum 4.99 g to a maximum of 11.75 g. Of the 212 accessions analysed, 43 accessions presented less than 6 g sugars, 159 accessions presented 6-9 g sugars and only 10 were greater than 9 g. Linamarin was not detected in the genotypes analysed. Applications and perspectives for cassava breeding programmes are discussed.

TI Indirect bioleaching of low-grade nickel limonite and saprolite ores
   using fungal metabolic organic acids generated by Aspergillus niger
SO HYDROMETALLURGY
AB The objective of the present study was to investigate the indirect bioleaching of low-grade nickel limonite and saprolite ores using fungal metabolic organic acids generated by Aspergillus niger. The indirect bioleaching experiments were carried out in a 2000 ml five-neck glass vessel containing 500 ml of the culture filtrate comprising fungal metabolic organic acids (which were obtained from organic acid biogeneration experiments after filtration) supplemented with limonite or saprolite ores. For the organic acid biogeneration experiments, the highest generation of organic acids by A. niger was achieved for cassava starch as carbon source in the presence of KH2PO4, (NH4)(2)SO4 and MgSO4 under aeration condition, which were subsequently employed for the indirect bioleaching experiments. The highest nickel leaching efficiencies from saprolite and limonite ores were 88.9% and 84.9%, respectively, which were obtained at leaching temperature of 95 degrees C, stirring speed of 400 mu m, ore particle size of -177 + 149 mu m, and leaching time of 4 h (for saprolite) and 24 h (for limonite). Most importantly, the leaching using the biogenerated organic acids in this study is highly selective to magnesium (Mg) and is relatively selective to iron (Fe), thus supporting their potential industrial applications with respect to economic and environmental concerns.

TI Effect of concentrated natural rubber latex on the properties and
   degradation behavior of cotton-fiber-reinforced cassava starch biofoam
SO INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB Eco-friendly starch biofoams derived from natural rubber were fabricated in this study. To overcome their two main shortcomings, i.e., lack of flexibility and susceptibility to moisture, cotton fiber and concentrated natural rubber latex (CNRL) were incorporated into the biofoam products. Cotton-fiber-reinforced cassava starch biofoams were successfully prepared by compression molding using water as the solvent, a processing aid, and a blowing agent. The morphology and the physical, flexural, and thermal properties of the starch biofoams as a function of the CNRL content were investigated. The moisture adsorption capacity of the foam decreased with increasing CNRL content up to 5 phr (-73.4% and -41.78% at 0 and 100% RH, respectively). With increasing CNRL content, the hydrophobicity of the biofoam increased, as evidenced by contact angle measurements; this result suggested better moisture resistance and dimensional stability. The flexural properties of the biofoams were tuned by adjusting the CNRL content. With the addition of the CNRL content of 2.5 phr, the elongation of the biofoam clearly improved by 24%, with an acceptable decrease (-2.2%) in the bending modulus. Biodegradation by the soil burial test revealed that the degradation of the biofoam mainly proceeds by hydrolysis, and the addition of CNRL retards the degradation of the biofoam.

TI Influence of UV filters on the texture profile and efficacy of a
   cosmetic formulation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COSMETIC SCIENCE
AB ObjectiveConsidering that many cosmetic products contain UV filters in their composition and that few studies have evaluated the role of UV filters in the physical properties and clinical efficacy of these products, the aim of this study was to assess the influence of UV filters on the properties and immediate effects of a cosmetic formulation.
   MethodsFour cosmetic formulations, vehicle (V), vehicle containing UV filters (F), vehicle containing cassava polysaccharides and alfalfa (A) oligosaccharides and vehicle containing UV filters plus cassava polysaccharides and alfalfa oligosaccharides (multifunctional formulation, M) were developed. The texture profile of the formulations was analysed with a TA.XT plus Texturometer((R)). Twenty female volunteers aged 39-45 years were then selected for the assessment of immediate clinical efficacy of the formulations under study and of transepidermal water loss (TEWL), stratum corneum water content and microrelief of the skin obtained with their use.
   ResultsThe presence of UV filters resulted in an improvement of the physical properties of the multifunctional cosmetic formulation (M) and of skin microrelief. However, the presence of UV filters also caused a significant decrease in hydration.
   ConclusionThe presence of sunscreens had a negative influence on immediate skin hydration and TEWL. On the other hand, it positively influenced parameters related to the physical properties of the multifunctional formulation and skin microrelief. Thus, we conclude that the influence of UV filters on the development of cosmetic formulations is an important factor to be considered because it can have either positive or negative effect on the efficacy of the product.

   easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe method and
   ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
   using a calibration based on a single level standard addition in the
   sample
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB full factorial design, was developed for the determination of 72 pesticides in plant parts of carrot, corn, melon, rice, soy, silage, tobacco, cassava, lettuce and wheat by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Considering the complexity of these matrices and the need of use calibration in matrix, a new calibration approach based on single level standard addition in the sample (SLSAS) was proposed in this work and compared with the matrix-matched calibration (MMC), the procedural standard calibration (PSC) and the diluted standard addition calibration (DSAC). All approaches presented satisfactory validation parameters with recoveries from 70 to 120% and relative standard deviations <= 20%. SLSAS was the most practical from the evaluated approaches and proved to be an effective way of calibration. Method limit of detection were between 4.8 and 48 mu g kg(-1) and limit of quantification were from 16 to 160 mu g kg(-4). Method application to different kinds of plants found residues of 20 pesticides that were quantified with z-scores values <= 2 in comparison with other calibration approaches. The proposed QuEChERS method combined with UHPLC-MS/MS analysis and using an easy and effective calibration procedure presented satisfactory results for pesticide residues determination in different crop plants and is a good alternative for routine analysis.

TI A switch point model for high-resolution moisture absorption isotherms
   of raw and pregelatinized starches
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD MEASUREMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION
AB The goal of this work was to find or create a simple model of the experimental high-resolution water absorption isotherms, determined with the dynamic dewpoint isotherm method (DDI) for different forms of starch powder. The samples used were rice and cassava starches and their 1:1 mix, each in raw and pregelatinized forms. The adsorption isotherms were measured at both 25 and 35 degrees C temperatures for the water activity range 0.2-0.9. The results showed that the modern DDI method provided densely measured isotherms with consistent characteristics. In particular, a linear zone in the adsorption isotherms of starch powders can be identified and its extent estimated. It is also subjectively clear with the DDI resolution across all the samples tested. Aside from smallish distinction between raw and pregelatinized cases, the starches had very similar isotherms, which might represent a "generic starch flour isotherm". This shape was very well fit by an initial linear segment and a final curved segment, with the critical transition at the switch point. The transition point results indicate that pregelatinization increases the demands on water barrier properties of the packaging.

TI Effect of modified cassava starch as a fat replacer on the texture and
   quality characteristics of muffins
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD MEASUREMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION
AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of modified cassava starch as a partial fat replacer on the quality characteristics of muffins. Cross-linked cassava starch (CCS) was used to replace fat at 8, 12 and 16% substitution levels, based on the total weight of the wheat flour. The thermal properties of the CCS and wheat flour were assessed, and the pasting and farinographic properties of the wheat flour-CCS mixtures were also evaluated. The addition of CCS had an adverse effect on the dough stability and development time, which decreased as the amount of CCS increased in the mixture. The gelatinization and retrogradation entalphies of the CCS were higher than those of the wheat flour. The final and setback viscosities of the wheat flour were higher than those of the wheat flour-CCS mixtures. Furthermore, the quality and textural characteristics of the muffins were determined. There were no significant differences in the weight loss, specific volume, crumb moisture content or color parameters of the muffins. The muffins containing CCS at fat replacement levels of 8% (T8) had the textural properties that were closest to those of the muffins without the CCS (control sample). Thus, this sample was chosen to evaluate the storage behavior over 7 days along with the control muffins. The T8 samples had a higher crumb firmness during the storage. There were no significant differences in the overall acceptability of the T8 and control muffins on days 2 and 4 of the storage. So, the T8 muffins had good acceptability by consumers despite having a higher firmness during the storage.

TI X-ray diffraction, rheological and FT-IR spectra studies of processed
   amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus)
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD MEASUREMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION
AB The X-ray diffraction pattern, rheological properties, particle size distribution and Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra of native and processed (cooked, germinated and fermented) amaranth were determined using different techniques. The data revealed that the native and processed amaranth flour showed major peak values of the 2 theta at 15 degrees, 18 degrees and 23 degrees resembling an A-type X-ray diffraction pattern. The percent crystallinity of fermented and germinated amaranth flour was higher than the native amaranth flour whereas loss in crystallinity was observed for cooked amaranth flour. Fermented amaranth flour showed the highest value while cooked amaranth flour showed the lowest value for storage (G') and loss modulus (G ''). The value of tana, was lower than 1 for native and processed amaranth dough. Native amaranth flour showed unimodal size distribution and the size of flour granules were ranged from 0.67 to 98.1 A mu m in diameter while the germinated and fermented amaranth flour showed bimodal distribution. The FT-IR spectroscopy provides the information about the product composition in the form of peaks. The peak for starch was obtained in the range of 994-1144 cm(-1). The proteins bands of native amaranth flour were reported at 1644 and 1545 cm(-1). The changes observed in physicochemical properties of amaranth flour after processing treatments provided a crucial basis for its potential applications on industrial scale.

TI Porous Cu/YSZ anodes processed by aqueous tape casting for IT-SOFC
SO JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
AB Porous copper/yttria-stabilized zirconia (Cu/YSZ) thin tapes were produced to be used as anodes in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC). The use of copper in these cermets promises a better chemical resistance and a lower operating temperature for SOFC. Graphite and cassava starch were used as pore forming agents, which led to porosity values between 30 and 40%. Tapes were obtained by aqueous tape casting with controlled thickness (300-2000 mu m). Before casting, CuO/YSZ aqueous suspensions were formulated based on rheological characterization. Sintering was carried out at 1150 degrees C during 1 h. Cu/YSZ tapes were obtained after redox reaction, performed at 400, 600 and 800 degrees C. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Hydrophilic modification of cellulose nanocrystals improves the
   physicochemical properties of cassava starch-based nanocomposite films
SO LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Carboxymethyl cellulose nanocrystals (N-CMCs) were produced by carboxymethylation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) that derived from sweet potato residue. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the N-CMCs which had a porous surface structure were more loosely packed and slightly larger with a uniform diameter ranging from 30 nm to 50 nm. N-CMCs with low viscosity (< 25 mPa s) and nano sized scale were used as reinforcement for preparing cassava starch-based films. Effect of N-CMCs varying 0.2 g/100 mL -0.5 g/100 mL was studied on physicochemical properties of N-CMCs/cassava starch films. N-CMCs/cassava starch film with 0.4 g/100 mL N-CMCs exhibited a 554% increase in tensile strength, 41% increase in elongation at break, and 123% increase in water solubility compared with the CNCs/cassava starch film. Moreover, the water vapor permeability and moisture absorption of the NCMCs/cassava starch film decreased by 42.7% and 15.9%, respectively. Better mechanical properties, water barrier properties and water solubility was achieved for the N-CMCs/cassava starch film than for the CNC/cassava starch film, indicating N-CMCs after carboxymethylation were beneficial for reinforcement of cassava starch-based films. The moisture absorption abilities of both cassava starch nanocomposite films were comparable. The results may be applied to the development of water-soluble and biodegradable edible films for food packaging. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Phytoextraction potential of Manihot esculenta Crantz. (cassava) grown
   in mercury- and gold-containing biosolids and mine tailings
SO MINERALS ENGINEERING
AB The potential of Manihot esculenta Crantz (cassava) to phytoextract Hg and Au from Hg- and Au-containing biosolids and mine tailings was successfully demonstrated for the first time. Removal of Hg by a hyper-accumulating plant species offers new options to clean up Hg-contaminated sites and at the same time harvest trace amounts of Au. Pre-rooted cassava cuttings with 5-7 nodes were grown in different combinations of biosolids-amended mine tailings to evaluate the best combination that will support optimum plant growth. The 75% biosolids - 25% mine tailings combination produced the best growth in cassava. Plant cuttings were also grown in hydroponics solutions amended with Hg and/or Au to determine root uptake of the two metals. Metals uptake was found to be greatest in the fibrous roots, accumulating up to 12.59 g kg(-1) Hg and 18.99 mg kg(-1) Au. Given its ease of cultivation and harvesting as well as the high accumulation of Hg and Au in its roots, cassava can be considered as a suitable candidate for Hg remediation and Au recovery from biosolids and mine tailings containing these metals.

TI Comparison of fermented animal feed and mushroom growth media as two
   value-added options for waste Cassava pulp management
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Cassava is one of the main processed crops in Thailand, but this generates large amounts (7.3 million tons in 2015) of waste cassava pulp (WCP). The solid WCP is sold directly to farmers or pulp-drying companies at a low cost to reduce the burden of on-site waste storage. Using an integrated direct and environmental cost model, fermented animal feed and mushroom growth media were compared as added-value waste management alternatives for WCP to mitigate environmental problems. Primary and secondary data were collected from the literature, field data, and case studies. Data boundaries were restricted to a gate-to-gate scenario with a receiving capacity of 500 t WCP/d, and based on a new production unit being set up at the starch factory. The total production cost of each WCP utilization option was analyzed from the economic and environmental costs. Fermented animal feed was an economically attractive scenario, giving a higher net present value (NPV), lower investment cost and environmental impact, and a shorter payback period for the 10-year operational period. The selling price of mushrooms was the most sensitive parameter regarding the NPV, while the NPV for the price of fermented animal feed had the highest value in the best-case scenario.

TI Composition, Granular Structure, and Pasting Properties of Native Starch
   Extracted from Plectranthus edulis (Oromo dinich) Tubers
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE
AB Chemical composition, granular morphology and pasting properties of native starch extracted from tubers of Plectranthus edulis were analyzed. Starch was extracted from tubers of 6 accessions collected from 4 different areas in Ethiopia. Particle size analysis (PSA) and cryo-scanning electron microscope (cryo-SEM) imaging were used to examine the granular morphology and visualize the starch paste, respectively. Pasting properties, water absorption, and gelation capacity were compared. A wide range was found for the amylose (14.2% to 23.9%), calcium (216 to 599), potassium (131 to 878), and phosphorus (1337 to 2090) contents (parts per million per dry matter). PSA showed a bimodal distribution containing small spherical (14.6 m) and large ellipse-shaped (190.4 m) granules. Major differences were found for the pasting with peak viscosities differing from 3184 to 7312 mPas. Starch from accessions Chencha and Inuka showed a difference in packing density as clearly seen through cryo-SEM image at 75% of the peak viscosity (PV), and the granular integrity was mainly responsible for the significant difference in their PV and breakdown. Principal component analysis revealed 2 distinct groups: native starch extracted from accessions at the Wolayta zone (Inuka, Lofua, and Chenqoua) and other accessions (Jarmet, Arjo white, and Chencha). The study revealed the potential of P. edulis starch for its application in food industries. However, the inherent variation due to environmental conditions on physicochemical properties of the starch needs further investigation.
   Practical ApplicationPlectranthus edulis is cultivated in considerable amounts throughout Ethiopia, which makes it a valuable starch source. Due to its low tendency to retrograde, it could be applied in food industry as an equivalent for the current starch sources. Moreover, the low amylose content makes it preferable for an application in refrigerated foods as this unique quality trait prevents syneresis in end products during storage. Based on the significantly higher pasting temperature of the studied P. edulis starch extracts, it can form an alternative for potato starch, which is less suitable for its use in pasteurized foods.

TI The role of the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), and farmer
   practices in the spread of cassava brown streak ipomoviruses
SO JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) is arguably the most dangerous current threat to cassava, which is Africa's most important food security crop. CBSD is caused by two RNA viruses: Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV). The roles of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) and farmer practices in the spread of CBSD were investigated in a set of field and laboratory experiments. The virus was acquired and transmitted by B. tabaci within a short time (5-10 min each for virus acquisition and inoculation), and was retained for up to 48 hr. Highest virus transmission (60%) was achieved using 20-25 suspected viruliferous whiteflies per plant that were given acquisition and inoculation periods of 24 and 48 hr, respectively. Experiments mimicking the agronomic practices of cassava leaf picking or the use of contaminated tools for making cassava stem cuttings did not show the transmission of CBSV or UCBSV. Screenhouse and field experiments in Tanzania showed that the spread of CBSD next to spreader rows was high, and that the rate of spread decreased with increasing distance from the source of inoculum. The disease spread in the field up to a maximum of 17 m in a cropping season. These results collectively confirm that CBSV and UCBSV are transmitted by B. tabaci semipersistently, but for only short distances in the field. This implies that spread over longer distances is due to movements of infected stem cuttings used for planting material. These findings have important implications for developing appropriate management strategies for CBSD.

SO PHYSIOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB Cassava is one of the main sources of energy for human populations in tropical countries. Cassava production can be severely reduced by diseases, such as the vascular bacteriosis (bacterial blight) caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis (Xam). In this study, the physiological behavior of plants from two cassava varieties, one resistant and one susceptible to infection by the Xam CIO151 strain was evaluated. The plants of the susceptible variety presented increased stomatal resistance, decreased leaf water potential and increased proline content compared with the resistant variety. On the other hand, the inoculated plants from the two varieties showed an increased accumulation of total sugars starting at 7 days post-inoculation compared with the non-inoculated plants.

Yet, such information is important for process design. In this work, continuous torque recording was found to be a suitable method to monitor the apparent viscosity. Reactions were performed in a bench scale reactor at ambient conditions with the monomer to starch ratio as the main variable. Apparent viscosity of the reaction mixture increased rapidly, which could be fitted with good accuracy with a first order exponential growth model. The maximum viscosity of 18 Pas was seen at the intermediate monomer to starch ratio of 1.0, a phenomenon that is in accordance with literature data. Starch thixotropy is influenced by the grafting of poly-acrylic acid, until it has almost disappeared at the highest monomer to starch molar ratio of 2.0. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 57:1285-1292, 2017.

TI Challenging Current Knowledge on Amazonian Dark Earths: Indigenous
   Manioc Cultivation on Different Soils of the Colombian Amazon
SO CULTURE AGRICULTURE FOOD AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Amazonian indigenous people grow manioc in landscapes of different agricultural potential, yet studies on indigenous manioc production on fertile soils are scarce. Non-indigenous communities grow specific manioc landraces on fertile Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE), but it is unknown whether indigenous farmers also do so. During 2years, we studied manioc cultivation by five indigenous groups on different Amazonian soils using quantitative and qualitative methods. We found that environmental conditions, including soil quality, are less important in determining manioc diversity and agricultural strategies than socioeconomic and socio-cultural factors such as labor availability, labor organization, and culinary preferences.

TI Potential Prebiotic Oligosaccharide Mixtures from Acidic Hydrolysis of
   Rice Bran and Cassava Pulp
SO PLANT FOODS FOR HUMAN NUTRITION
AB Two agricultural wastes, rice bran and cassava pulp were subjected to acidic hydrolysis by 2 M sulfuric acid which resulted in hemicellulosic oligosaccharide mixtures. Monosaccharide component analysis of these mixtures revealed that the oligosaccharides of rice bran acid hydrolysate (RAHF) composed of glucose and arabinose while cassava pulp acid hydrolysate (CAHF) was found to be comprised of glucose, galactose and arabinose. Both RAHF and CAHF were able to fuel all of the tested three Lactobacillus, five Bifidobacterium and three Bacteroides strains indicating the prebiotic potential of these oligosaccharide mixtures. Moreover, Lb. gasseri grew significantly better on RAHF than on inulin, a benchmark prebiotic oligo- and polysaccharide mixture. When the digestibility of RAHF and CAHF were tested it was found that these oligosaccharide mixtures were only slightly hydrolyzed upon exposure to simulated human gastric (by less than 8%) and pancreatic juices (by less than 3%). Additionally, most sensory attributes of the above obtained oligosaccharide mixtures supplemented two model cereal drink formulations were generally not different from those of the control, while the overall acceptance was not affected significantly in one cereal drink formulation.

TI The SWEET gene family in Hevea brasiliensis - its evolution and
   expression compared with four other plant species
SO FEBS OPEN BIO
AB SWEET proteins play an indispensable role as a sugar efflux transporter in plant development and stress responses. The SWEET genes have previously been characterized in several plants. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of this gene family in the rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis. There are 36 members of the SWEET gene family in this species, making it one of the largest families in plant genomes sequenced so far. Structure and phylogeny analyses of these genes in Hevea and in other species demonstrated broad evolutionary conservation. RNA-seq analyses revealed that SWEET2, 16, and 17 might represent the main evolutionary direction of SWEET genes in plants. Our results in Hevea suggested the involvement of HbSWEET1a, 2e, 2f, and 3b in phloem loading, HbSWEET10a and 16b in laticifer sugar transport, and HbSWEET9a in nectary-specific sugar transport. Parallel studies of RNA-seq analyses extended to three other plant species (Manihot esculenta, Populus trichocarpa, and Arabidopsis thaliana) produced findings which implicated MeSWEET10a, 3a, and 15b in M. esculenta storage root development, and the involvement of PtSWEET16b and PtSWEET16d in P. trichocarpa xylem development. RT-qPCR results further revealed that HbSWEET10a, 16b, and 1a play important roles in phloem sugar transport. The results from this study provide a foundation not only for further investigation into the functionality of the SWEET gene family in Hevea, especially in its sugar transport for latex production, but also for related studies of this gene family in the plant kingdom.

TI Water sorption and water permeability properties of edible film made
   from potato peel waste
SO FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The water sorption and permeability properties of edible film produced from potato peel waste was investigated under different levels of relative humidity (23, 33, 43, 57, 75% RH) and temperatures (5, 30, 50 degrees C). The water sorption behaviour and isotherms of the film were investigated by fitting water sorption data to the Peleg model and the Guggenheim, Anderson de Boer model (GAB model). The amount of moisture content, time required for the moisture content of the film to reach equilibrium, water sorption rate, and water sorption capacity increased when the relative humidity increased. The effect of temperature on moisture content, water sorption rate, water sorption capacity, and monolayer moisture content is complex and related to the water activity as well as the moisture content. Based on R-2 and RMSE values, the Peleg and GAB models were respectively determined as excellent models to predict the water sorption properties of the films, thus supporting the reliability of water sorption behaviour prediction. The water vapour transmission rate and water vapour permeability increased with an increase in relative humidity and temperature. The sorption and permeability properties of the film are worth investigation since the final application of the film as food packaging is ultimately dependent on these behaviours.

TI Tucupi creamy paste: development, sensory evaluation and rheological
   characterization
SO FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Tucupi, a fermented product obtained from cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is widely employed in the cuisine of the Northern region of Brazil, however, its industrial application is incipient. This study used tucupi to prepare a creamy paste, which underwent sensory and rheological evaluation. Paste formulations with 5 to 20% concentrated tucupi were obtained. An acceptance test was used to assess the product's acceptability regarding the attributes of color, aroma, flavor, texture, and overall impression. A purchase intention test of the product was also applied. The product's rheology was studied at 25, 40, and 60 degrees C and the activation energy (E-a) was estimated. The internal preference mapping indicated that the paste formulation with 5% and 10% tucupi were the most accepted by the judge, but only the 10% tucupi paste was characterized. Proportions greater than 15% tucupi influenced negatively in the flavor and texture of the product. Purchase intention test showed that 99% of the judges demonstrated interest in purchasing the product. The product presented 72.7% moisture, 10.4% lipids, 0.5% proteins, 2.1% ashes, 14.3% carbohydrates, and 7.4 mu g/g beta-carotene. According to the rheological assays, the paste presented characteristics of a pseudoplastic fluid. The Herschel-Bulkley model proved efficient to predict the flow curves for the product in the temperature range tested, for which Ea was estimated at 7.49 kJ/mol.

TI Effects of Starch Sources and Supplementary Materials on Starch Based
   Foam Trays
SO JOURNAL OF POLYMERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB Firstly, foam trays were produced from glyoxal cross-linked wheat, potato and corn starches and their mixtures. The most suitable starch type for starch-based foam tray production was selected according to the level of water absorption, density, surface and cross-section micrographs of the foam trays. It was decided that a wheat and potato starch blend was the most suitable starch source for producing the foam trays because they have the lowest water absorption percentage (25.5 +/- 0.7%), low density (0.17 +/- 0.01 g/cm(3)) and a smooth surface. Potato-wheat starch foam trays with fibres were produced by adding wheat and wood fibres. Unlike wood fibres addition, wheat fibres significantly decreased the percentage of water absorption (16.63 +/- 1.2%) and density (0.115 +/- 0.013 g/cm(3)) of the tray. Also, the trays including wheat fibre had a lighter colour than the wheat-potato starch tray. To further reduce water absorption of the tray, the trays were made by adding two different types of lipids (beeswax or shortening and three different types of filler materials-kaolin, montmorillonite or zinc oxide nanoparticles). According to the level of water absorption of the trays, it was decided that shortening and zinc oxide nanoparticles, in addition to kaolin, were respectively the most suitable lipid and filler materials. The foam trays were produced by adding these supplementary materials. The addition of shortening slightly, zinc oxide nanoparticles moderately and kaolin greatly increased the density of the wheat potato starch tray including fibre. However, the percent of water absorption of the trays containing wheat fibre + shortening or wheat fibre + shortening + zinc oxide nanoparticles decreased 6.4 +/- 0.01 and 5.9 +/- 0.3%, respectively.

SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS
AB High-pressure carbon dioxide switchable solution with 1,8-diazabicyclo [5.4.0] undec-7-ene (DBU) and ethylene glycol (EG) was applied for a dissolution and modification of cellulose derived from a cassava pulp waste. The switchable solution of DBU and EG were formed by adding carbon dioxide under a pressure range of 0.1-10.0 MPa and a temperature range of 298 and 333 K. The cellulose was dissolved into the CO2 switchable system at a pressure of 0.1 and 5.8 MPa and a temperature of 313 K. The precipitates of bicarbonate salt of reaction between DBU and carbon dioxide were observed in the switchable solution at the higher pressures and lower temperatures. The cellulose was also modified in the switchable solution with the ionized DBU, EG and carbon dioxide as analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The modified cellulose was then utilized for the fabrication of the transparent film.

TI Evaluation of proximate composition and pasting properties of high

   Crantz) of 13-carotene-enriched roots
SO LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Cassava farmers are yet to fully exploit its full potential in terms of improvement of livelihood. Forty-five genotypes of cassava genotypes were processed into High Quality Cassava Flour (HQCF). These genotypes were planted in two sets, set 1 comprised 22 clones of 0 -carotene enriched roots and 3 check clones of white roots and set 2 comprised 18 clones and 2 check clones. The effects of variety on the proximate composition and pasting profile of the flour were investigated. The starch content ranged between 67.1 g/100 g (for 01/1663) and 82.4 g/100 g (for 30572) in set 1 and between 69.6 (01/1560) to 77.8 g/100 g (for Z97/0474) in set 2. Peak viscosity values ranged between 295.6 RVU (rapid visco unit) (30572) and 467.0 RVU (01/1115) across clones in set 1 while for set 2, it ranged from 271.9 RVU (for 01/1404) to 471.3 RVU (for 01/1417). Significant differences (P < 0,05) existed in the proximate composition and pasting properties of the flour from different cassava genotypes investigated. The high peak viscosity exhibited by most genotypes is indicative that the flour may be suitable for products requiring high gel strength and elasticity. The proximate composition compares competitively with values obtainable from conventional clones. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Energy and environmental assessments of bioethanol production from Sri
   Kanji 1 cassava in Malaysia
SO BIOFUEL RESEARCH JOURNAL-BRJ
AB According to the Malaysia's biofuel policy, renewable fuels are crucial for energy sustainability in the transportation sector in the future. This study was aimed to evaluate the potential of bioethanol production from Sri Kanji 1 cassava in Malaysia in terms of energy efficiency and renewability, as well to estimate the potential greenhouse gas ( GHG) emissions reduction in CO2 equivalent. Bioethanol production process from cassava includes cassava farming, ethanol production, and transportation in which the primary energy consumption was considered. The Net Energy Balance ( NEB) and Net Energy Ratio ( NER) of 25.68 MJ/L and 3.98, respectively, indicated that bioethanol production from Sri Kanji 1 cassava in Malaysia was energy efficient. From the environmental perspective, the GHG balance results revealed that the production and distribution of 1 L of Cassava Fuel Ethanol ( CFE) could reduce GHG emissions by 73.2%. Although found promising in the present study, Sri Kanji 1 cassava as bioethanol feedstock should be further investigated by constructing an actual ethanol plant to obtain real life data.

TI Unusual occurrence of a DAG motif in the Ipomovirus Cassava brown streak
   virus and implications for its vector transmission
SO PLOS ONE
AB Cassava is the main staple food for over 800 million people globally. Its production in eastern Africa is being constrained by two devastating Ipomoviruses that cause cassava brown streak disease (CBSD); Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV), with up to 100% yield loss for smallholder farmers in the region. To date, vector studies have not resulted in reproducible and highly efficient transmission of CBSV and UCBSV. Most virus transmission studies have used Bemisia tabaci (whitefly), but a maximum of 41% U/CBSV transmission efficiency has been documented for this vector. With the advent of next generation sequencing, researchers are generating whole genome sequences for both CBSV and UCBSV from throughout eastern Africa. Our initial goal for this study was to characterize U/CBSV whole genomes from CBSD symptomatic cassava plants sampled in Kenya. We have generated 8 new whole genomes (3 CBSV and 5 UCBSV) from Kenya, and in the process of analyzing these genomes together with 26 previously published sequences, we uncovered the aphid transmission associated DAG motif within coat protein genes of all CBSV whole genomes at amino acid positions 52-54, but not in UCBSV. Upon further investigation, the DAG motif was also found at the same positions in two other Ipomoviruses: Squash vein yellowing virus (SqVYV), Coccinia mottle virus (CocMoV). Until this study, the highly-conserved DAG motif, which is associated with aphid transmission was only noticed once, in SqVYV but discounted as being of minimal importance. This study represents the first comprehensive look at Ipomovirus genomes to determine the extent of DAG motif presence and significance for vector relations. The presence of this motif suggests that aphids could potentially be a vector of CBSV, SqVYV and CocMov. Further transmission and ipomoviral protein evolutionary studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

TI Digestibility of starches isolated from stem and root tubers of
   arracacha, cassava, cush-cush yam, potato and taro
SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB Digestibility of arracacha, cassava, cush-cush yam, potato and taro starches was evaluated. In vitro (potentially available starch and total resistant starch) and in vivo digestibility in the rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae) bioassay (survival, weight variation, alpha-amylase like activity [ALA], and uric acid excretion [UAE] as biomarkers) were estimated. In in vitro assays, all starches presented high resistant starch content (14-56%, dry basis), except for cassava starch. In in vivo assays, cush-cush yam and potato starches promoted higher ALA ( > 3 times) and UAE ( > 4 times) compare to a reference diet (cornstarch), in agreement to their low digestibility. These two biomarkers were related with resistant starch (r > 0.81) and could be used to predict the starch bioavailability. This study demonstrates that the use of both in vitro and in vivo assays allows a better evaluation of starch digestibility, and may help to elucidate the final metabolic fate of starch digestion products.

AB Active and smart biodegradable films from cassava starch and glycerol with 5 wt.% of different natural extracts such as green tea and basil were obtained by casting. Their functional capacity as antioxidants and their physicochemical properties achieved from the incorporation of these types of extracts were evaluated. The content of phenolic compounds in the extracts led to films with significant antioxidant activity, being greater in the case of the system containing green tea extract. Color changes in both materials after immersion in different media (acid and basic) due to the presence of chlorophyll and carotenoids in the extracts were observed, but the film with basil extract reacted most notably to the different pH. These films degraded in soil under two weeks and were thermal stable up to 240 degrees C. Finally, the incorporation of extracts of green tea and basil led to thermoplastic starch films with lower water vapor permeability retaining their flexibility.

TI Developing an intelligent film containing Vitis amurensis husk extracts:
   The effects of pH value of the film-forming solution
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Bio-based films have become preferred because of their biodegradability and availability from reproducible resources. Vitis amurensis husk is a byproduct of white-wine processing. The colors of Vitis amurensis husk extracts vary from red to green as the pH value increases from 2 to 12. A new bio-based intelligent colorimetric film was developed by incorporating Vitis amurensis husk extracts into the tara gum/cellulose matrix. The effects of pH value (3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) of the film-forming solution on the color, transparency, morphology, mechanical properties, barrier properties, and moisture uptake properties of the films were investigated. The color of the film changed from pink to yellow-green as the pH value of the film-forming solution increased from 3 to 7. The scanning electron microscope results showed that the cross sections of the film formed at pH of 3, 6 and 7 showed a wrinkled appearance. The reduction of the tensile strength and oxygen permeability were related to the wrinkle appearance. The resulting films changed in color after immersion in solutions with different pH values. Similar color changes occurred, and there was an apparent difference in the monitoring test for fish products. The film formed at pH 6 changed to green in 48 h, and the other film at pH 3, 4, and 5 changed in 60 h, indicating that it had a better sensitivity. This study showed that an intelligent colorimetric film can be utilized as a visual indicator for food quality assurance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Potential of golden potatoes to improve vitamin A and vitamin E status
   in developing countries
SO PLOS ONE
AB Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the third most widely consumed plant food by humans. Its tubers are rich in starch and vitamin C, but have low or null levels of essential nutrients such as provitamin A and vitamin E. Transformation of potato with a bacterial mini-pathway for beta-carotene in a tuber-specific manner results in a "golden" potato (GP) tuber phenotype resulting from accumulation of provitamin A carotenoids (alpha- and beta-carotene) and xanthophylls. Here, we investigated the bioaccessibility of carotenoids and vitamin E as alpha-tocopherol (aTC) in boiled wild type and golden tubers using in vitro digestion. Golden tubers contained up to 91 mu g provitamin A carotenes (PAC)/g D, increased levels of xanthophylls, phytoene and phytofluene, as well as up to 78 pg vitamin E/g DW. Cubes from wild type and GP tubers were boiled and subjected to simulated digestion to estimate bioaccessibility of carotenoids and alpha TC. Retention in boiled GPs exceeded 80% for beta-carotene (beta C), alpha-carotene (alpha C), lutein, phytoene and alpha TC, but less than 50% for phytofluene. The efficiency of partitioning of total beta C, alpha C, E-lutein, phytoene, phytofluene and alpha TC in the mixed micelle fraction during small intestinal digestion was influenced by genotype, tuber content and hydrophobicity. Apical uptake of the compounds that partitioned in mixed micelles by monolayers of human intestinal Caco-2 cells during incubation for 4h was 14-20% for provitamin A and xanthophylls, 43-45% for phytoene, 23-27% for phytofluene, and 53% for alpha TC. These results suggest that a 150 g serving of boiled golden potatoes has the potential to contribute 42% and 23% of the daily requirement of retinol activity equivalents (RAE), as well as 34 and 17% of the daily vitamin E requirement for children and women of reproductive age, respectively.

TI Hydrolysis of part of cassava starch into nanocrystals leads to
   increased reinforcement of nanocomposite films
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB This article reports on using cassava starch nanocrystals (CSN) to strengthen nanocomposite films from the same matrix. CSN were obtained by acid hydrolysis. Nanocomposite (starch: glycerol: CSN/4.0:2.1:1-10 wt %) were processed by casting and the films were characterized. The CSN (30% yield) presented minimally clustered globular forms, 45 to 178 nm in diameter, with a crystalline index of 46%. Water-vapor transmission rate, tensile strength, and elastic modulus of the films were influenced by the linear effect of CSN concentration (R-2 = -0.92, 0.91, 0.99, respectively), while the other parameters resulted in quadratic relations 10.69-0.961. The film with 10% CSN presented a 43% reduction in water vapor permeability, associated with increases of 200% in traction resistance, and 616% in elasticity modulus, compared with the control. The hydrolysis of part of the cassava starch into nanocrystals resulted in a reduction in permeability and nano reinforcement of the films due to good compatibility and interaction between both, without influencing biodegradability.

TI The MAPKKK gene family in cassava: Genome-wide identification and
   expression analysis against drought stress
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs), an important unit of MAPK cascade, play crucial roles in plant development and response to various stresses. However, little is known concerning the MAPKKK family in the important subtropical and tropical crop cassava. In this study, 62 MAPKKK genes were identified in the cassava genome, and were classified into 3 subfamilies based on phylogenetic analysis. Most of MAPKKKs in the same subfamily shared similar gene structures and conserved motifs. The comprehensive transcriptome analysis showed that MAPKKK genes participated in tissue development and response to drought stress. Comparative expression profiles revealed that many MAPKKK genes were activated in cultivated varieties SC124 and Arg7 and the function of MeMAPKKKs in drought resistance may be different between SC124/Arg7 and W14. Expression analyses of the 7 selected MeMAPKKK genes showed that most of them were significantly upregulated by osmotic, salt and ABA treatments, whereas slightly induced by H2O2 and cold stresses. Taken together, this study identified candidate MeMAPKKK genes for genetic improvement of abiotic stress resistance and provided new insights into MAPKKK-mediated cassava resistance to drought stress.

TI Soil fertility regulates invasive herbivore performance and top-down
   control in tropical agroecosystems of Southeast Asia
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB In terrestrial ecosystems, changes in soil nutrient availability, plant growth or natural enemies can generate important shifts in abundance of organisms at various trophic levels. In agroecosystems the performance of (invasive) herbivores and their impacts on crops is of particular concern. Scientists are presently challenged with making reliable inferences on invader success, natural enemy performance and efficacy of biological control, particularly in tropical agroecosystems. In this study, we assess how trophic regulatory forces (bottom-up vs. top down) influence the success of three globally important pests of cassava. We examine the mealybug species (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) of differing host breadth and invasion history: Phenacoccus manihoti, Paracoccus marginatus, and Pseudococcus jackbeardsleyi. Potted plant fertilizer trials were combined with a regional survey in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia of 65 cassava fields of similar size and age, but with varying soil fertility. Relative abundance of each mealybug invader was mapped along a soil fertility gradient, and contrasted with site-specific measures of parasitism. Potted plant trials revealed strong bottom-up effects for P. manihoti, such that impacts of nitrogen and potassium additions were propagated through to higher trophic levels and substantially boost development and fitness of its specialist parasitoid, Anctgyrus lopezi (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae). Field surveys indicate that mealybug performance is highly species-specific and context-dependent. For example, field-level abundance of P. jackbeardsleyi and P. marginatus, was related to measures of soil fertility parameters, soil texture and plant disease incidence. Furthermore, for P. manihoti, in-field abundance is equally associated with soil texture (i.e., silt content). Principal component analysis (PCA) and regression suggested that P. manihoti and P. marginatus are disproportionately favored in low-fertility conditions, while P. jackbeardsleyi prospers in settings with high organic carbon and phosphorus. Parasitism of P. manihoti by A. lopezi varied greatly with field and soil fertility conditions, and was highest in soils with intermediate fertility levels and where management practices include the addition of fertilizer supplements. Our characterization of the relative performance of invasive mealybugs and strength of parasitism across variable soil fertility conditions will help guide parasitoid release programs and soil management practices that enhance mealybug biological control.

TI Application of DEA and statistical inference to model the determinants
   of biomethane production efficiency: A case study in south China
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Global interest in the conversion of organic biowaste to biomethane is increasing rapidly. As new projects are built, managers must ensure that biomethane engineering processes are operating efficiently. In China, increasing biogas energy output is an integral part of the central government's 13th Five Year Plan. However, many biogas plants that convert various organic waste types to energy in China operate inefficiently. In this context, the objective of this research is to investigate the determinants of efficiency in a major biogas engineering pilot project that converts municipal, industrial and agricultural waste into biomethane vehicle fuel. The methodology involved applying data envelopment analysis and multiple linear regression to determine factors statistically significant for fluctuations in performance efficiency. The results provided important insights. First, variables statistically significant for the production of primary outputs were isolated. The variables most influential for biomethane production included bagasse input, fish waste input, and cassava input. As for solid fertilizer output, the most influential variables included manure input, fish waste, other input, and FeCl2. Secondly, the surveyed case was found to have significant scale inefficiencies, which has important implications for optimization of industrial scale co-digestion projects. As time progressed, the project experienced decreasing returns to scale, indicating that although overall inputs increased, production per unit of input decreased. Third, specific input/output targets and slacks were computed in order to identify changes required for the project to become efficient at certain points in time over the survey period. Fourth, possible determinants of efficiency were analyzed. The paper concludes with several engineering management and policy suggestions to enhance biomethane conversion efficiency.

TI SALINE STRESS ONTO GROWTH AND PHYSIOLOGY OF TRIFOLIATE CITRUS HYBRIDS
   DURING ROOTSTOCK FORMATION
SO BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
AB High salts concentrations in soil and water are common in semi-arid regions, which reduces the growth and development of crops, especially sensitive plants, such as citrus, being important to identify tolerant materials as well as to study the physiology of these plants. An experiment was conducted evaluate the growth and physiology of citrus trifoliate citrus hybris during their early stage of development (seedling stage) under salt stress conditions. These hydrids were obtained through the Citrus Breeding Program of Embrapa Cassava & Fruits consisting of 'Common sunki' mandarin x 'Argentina' citrange-019, 'Common sunki' mandarin x ('Rangpur' lime x Poncirus trifoliata)-040, Trifoliate hybrids-069, 116 and 127, distributed in a randomized block design with three replications. Nucellar seedlings of the genotypes were grown in an hydroponic system using Leonard jars. The application of nutrient solution with saline water started 90 days after sowing, extending to 120 days, when the seedlings were evaluated for plant growth and physiology. The genotypes common 'Sunki' mandarin x 'Argentina' citrange-019, Common 'Sunki' mandarin x ('Rangpur' lime x P. trifoliata)-040 and Trifoliate hybrid-069 showed the greater tolerance to salinity, while the Trifoliate hybrid-116 and 127 were found to be the less tolerant.

TI Bionanocomposites produced from cassava starch and oil palm mesocarp
   cellulose nanowhiskers
SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB Cassava starch films reinforced with cellulose nanowhiskers from oil palm mesocarp fibers were produced by casting. Nanowhiskers were obtained by sulphuric acid hydrolysis followed by microfluidization and incorporated in starch films at various loadings (1-10 wt%). Morphological and mechanical characterizations showed that the reinforcing effect of oil palm cellulose nanowhiskers was significant at loadings of up to 6 wt%, which was determined to be the nanowhiskers percolation threshold. Above this content, formation of agglomerates became more significant, causing a decrease in mechanical properties of starch bionanocomposites. Below percolation threshold, such as 2 wt%, elongation at break increased by 70%, showing an effective reinforcing effect. Dynamic mechanical analyses revealed filler/matrix interactions through hydrogen bonding in bionanocomposites. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of hydrothermal-alkali and freezing-thawing pre-treatments on
   modification of corn starch with octenyl succinic anhydride
SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB Pre-treatments by freezing/thawing (F/T) and hydrothermal-alkali (HA) were used in the modification of starch with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA). In comparison with OSA-modified starch prepared without pre-treatment (degree of substitution, DS = 0.0172; reaction efficiency, RE = 73.9%), HA pre-treatment increased the DS of OSA-starch and RE of subsequent OSA modification (0.0185 and 79.7%, respectively). In contrast, F/T pre-treatment gave the opposite results (0.0152 and 65.5%, respectively). OSA modification markedly increased the viscosities but decreased the gelatinization parameters of native starch. Esterification of starch by OSA was confirmed with Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy, which indicated markedly decreased short-range molecular orders of native starch. The present study showed that HA pre-treatment before OSA modification is an efficient way to improve the reaction efficiency of OSA with starch and thereby to modify the pasting properties of starch. F/T pre-treatment did not increase the reaction efficiency of starch with OSA. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Tapioca Biofilm Containing Nitrogen-doped Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles
   for Electrochemical Detection of 17-beta Estradiol
SO ELECTROANALYSIS
AB A novel sensor architecture based on thin film of tapioca decorated within nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (N-TiO2) nanoparticles is reported. The nano-structures were characterized by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, X-rays diffraction and voltammetric techniques. The proposed electrode was used for detection of low concentrations of 17-beta estradiol in without purification step, which was investigated by using linear sweep adsorptive stripping voltammetry. Under optimal conditions, the analytical curve was linear over a 17 beta-estradiol concentration range of 9.9x10(-6) to 1.4x10(-5) molL(-1), with a detection limit of 1.7x10(-7) molL(-1). The tapioca and N-TiO2 nanoparticles homogeneous film was applied for detection of 17-beta-estradiol in tap water and synthetic urine samples, which presented satisfactory results.

TI Antimicrobial properties and release of cinnamaldehyde in bilayer films
   based on polylactic acid (PLA) and starch
SO EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL
AB Cinnamaldehyde (CIN) loaded amorphous PIA films were obtained by casting, using ethyl acetate as solvent. Likewise, bilayer films were obtained by thermocompression of the PLA active layer and compression moulded cassava starch (S) films or semi crystalline PLA films. Starch-PLA laminated materials were considered to improve the barrier capacity (high oxygen barrier through the starch layer and high water vapour capacity through the polyester layer), while CIN incorporation confers antimicrobial activity on the films. The PLA bilayers were obtained for comparison purposes. The antimicrobial activity of the CIN loaded PLA films and S bilayer films was proved against Escherichia coil and Listeria Innocua through in vitro tests, which indicates that the active amount released into the growth medium exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of both bacteria. The release kinetics of the active compound in different food simulants demonstrated theta part of CIN was tightly bonded to the PIA matrix, whereas the free compound diffused more easily through the starch layer, making S bilayers more active against the bacteria when the starch layer was in direct contact with the culture medium. CIN entrapped in PLA bilayers did not exhibited any antibacterial effect due to its release inhibition, associated to its bohding within the PIA matrix and the lower degree of relaxation in the semi crystalline PIA layer in contact with the food simulants.

TI Quantitative assessment of the microbiological risk associated with the
   consumption of attieke in Cote d'Ivoire
SO FOOD CONTROL
AB Attieke is produced and consumed throughout the entire territory of Cote d'Ivoire. It is a food made by lactic fermentation of cassava and prepared in advance. It is the first ready-to eat meal sold in the towns of Cote d'Ivoire and increasingly in other African countries. For those reasons, we studied the quantitative assessment of the microbiological risk associated with this product. The objectives were firstly to appreciate the microbiological quality of attieke sold on the markets of major cities, and secondly, to quantitatively assess risk for Clostridium perfringens in attieke. To achieve these objectives, a microbiological analysis of attieke samples sold on the open markets was carried out in order to enumerate C. perfringens and some indicator microorganisms of the microbiological quality of the food: Aerobic mesophiles, total coliforms, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. A household survey was also conducted to estimate the daily attieke consumption per individual. Statistical analysis of the average concentration for each microorganism in attieke reveals a great variability generally highly significant (p < 0.01) between the markets. Some concentrations were exceeded the acceptable microbial limits. This was the case for E. coli (>10(2) cfu/g) at Daloa and Abengourou, and S. aureus on all areas or towns (>10(5) cfu/g) except Yamoussoukro. Concerning the results about the quantitative risk assessment for C. perfringens, 38% of servings sold contain concentrations exceeded the acceptable limit of 10(5) cfu/g for the readyto eat meals. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, the probability of ingesting a dose greater than 10(9) bacterias of C perfringens varied between 1.27% and 2.80%. This means that for every 100 000 individuals consuming per day attieke sold in retail, 1270 to 2800 could be potential victims of foodborne illness outbreaks caused by C. perfringens only.

TI Effect of blueberry agro-industrial waste addition to corn starch-based
   films for the production of a pH-indicator film
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB Intelligent packaging is an emerging area of food technology that can provide better preservation and be of further convenience for consumers. It is recommended that biodegradable materials be used to develop low-impact designs for better packaging, which could benefit the environment by simply expanding their use to new areas. In this work, corn starch, glycerol and blueberry powder (with and without prior fruit bleaching) were used to produce films by casting. Blueberry powder, a co-product from juice processing, which is rich in anthocyanins, was added in the films to evaluate its potential as a colorimetric indicator, due to the ability of anthocyanin to change color when placed in an acidic or basic environment. After the films were immersed in different buffer solutions, visual color changes were observed, where the films became reddish at acidic pH and bluish at basic pH. The Delta E* values were greater than 3, suggesting a visually perceptible change to the human eye. The samples with fruit bleaching (CB) were visually darker (lower luminance values), while the samples without bleaching (SB) had a lighter color and higher brightness, represented by larger L* values. These results indicate the potential of blueberry powder as a pH indicator for intelligent food packaging or even for sensing food deterioration. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Rheological, thermal and microstructural properties of whey protein
   isolate-modified cassava starch mixed gels at different pH values
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The objective of this study was to investigate the rheological, thermal and microstructural properties of whey protein isolate (WPI)-hydroxypropylated cassava starch (HPCS) gels and WPI-cross-linked cassava starch (CLCS) gels at different pH values (5.75, 7.00 and 9.00). The rheological results showed that the WPI-modified starch gels had greater storage modulus (G') values than the WPI-native cassava starch gels at pH 5.75 and 7.00. Differential scanning calorimetry curves suggested that the phase transition order of the WPI and modified starch changed as the pH increased. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that the addition of HPCS and CLCS contributed to the formation of a compact microstructure at pH 5.75 and 7.00. A comprehensive analysis showed that the gelling properties of the WPI-modified starch were affected by the difference between the WPI denaturation temperature and modified starch gelatinisation temperature and by the granular properties of the modified starch during gelatinisation. These results may contribute to the application of WPI-modified starch mixtures in food preparation.

TI Genome-wide association study for resistance to cassava root rot
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB Cassava root rot (CRR) disease associated with a complex of soil pathogens has caused great yield losses in the crop. The objective of the current work was to obtain insights about the genetic architecture of CRR resistance caused by Fusarium (dry root rot - DRR), Phytophthora (soft root rot - SRR) and Botryosphaeriaceae (black root rot - BRR) species, using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Phenotyping data of 263 accessions (artificial inoculation) and 14 094 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (missing data <0.10 and minor allele frequency >0.05) were used. The severity of CRR in peel and pulp was variable among accessions, but the pathogens that caused DRR were more aggressive. Broad-sense heritability (h(g)(2)) was of medium magnitude for all groups of resistances for pathogens, with variation from 0.16 +/- 0.019 (Fspp Pulp) to 0.31 +/- 0.028 (Fspp Peel). The kinship matrix was used to correct for stratification as well as for clustering the accessions. Overall, this analysis showed that there was no relationship between agronomic traits and resistance to CRR and the four clusters obtained from kinship matrix. The GWAS identified 38 significant SNPs, of which eight and 22 are related to the severity of DRR in the pulp and peel, respectively. The other eight SNPs were associated with SRR-peel (1), SRR-pulp (1), BRR-peel (3) and BRR-pulp (3). Half of the SNPs associated with CRR resistance have functional annotations related to defence and response to pathogen attack as well as general cellular processes. The current study revealed that resistance to CRR is controlled by multiple loci with small effects, and significant SNPs can be used to identify putative genes that control these traits.

TI Application of active cassava starch films incorporated with oregano
   essential oil and pumpkin residue extract on ground beef
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD SAFETY
AB An antimicrobial and antioxidant film based on cassava starch incorporated with oregano essential oil (2% w/v) and pumpkin residue extract (3% w/v) was developed for application onto ground beef. A control film (without additives) was used for comparison. The film's physical, barrier, antioxidant (DPPH), and antimicrobial properties were analyzed. The addition of oil does not contribute to reducing the film's water vapor permeability or impact solubility values. Regarding the application of the film on ground beef, the addition of oregano oil demonstrated antimicrobial activity against mesophilic bacteria, coliforms, and Salmonella. The film also showed significant antioxidant activity. Meat color and pH were assessed and it was found that the film contributed to keeping the pH at low values until the sixth day of storage, but had no influence in maintaining color in the samples. Based on the results, the film may be used as an alternative to packaging because it can contribute to ground beef quality and safety.
   Practical applicationDeveloped films have antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, and the latter was proven when applied in ground beef. The film characteristics show that it may be applied in other foods such as cheeses and other meat cuts to avoid the multiplication of microorganisms. These films can be used as extra conventional packaging protection and its implementation would improve the microbiological quality and contribute to the safety and quality of packaged food.

   methods to characterize cassava, corn and wheat flours using
   chemometrics
SO MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
CT 4th Uruguayan Conference on Analytical Chemistry
CY SEP 25-28, 2016
CL Montevideo, URUGUAY
AB In this work, microwave-assisted digestion sample treatment and two ICP-based method operational conditions were optimized to determine 17 elements in cassava, corn and wheat flours using experimental design. The proposed analytical methods showed acceptable sensitivity, with limits of quantification for Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, S, Sb, Sr and Zn ranging from 0.02 mu g g(-1)(Cd, Co and Sb) up to 0.002% (S) employing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). The accuracy of the analytical methods was confirmed by analysis of certified reference materials of rice flour (NIST 1568a), wheat flour (NIST 1567a) and Tea (NCS DC 73351), with agreement between 82 +/- 3% (Cr) and 108 +/- 10% (Fe). Precision was expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD) and the found values were lower than 9% (Fe, n = 3) for all elements, except for Cd by ICP-MS, whose RSD value was 14%. The proposed methods were then used to determine the mineral composition of 37 samples of cassava, corn and wheat flours bought in commercial establishments in Aracaju city, Sergipe State Brazil. The Ca, K, P, Mg and S concentrations ranged from 2.72 +/- 1.09 mu g g(-1) for Ca up to 4253 +/- 103 Kg g(-1) for K. The concentrations of the microelements and trace elements, such as Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Sr and Zn, varied between <0.02 mu g g(-1) for Sr up to 65.5 +/- 9.7 mu g g(-1) for Fe. Cassava, corn and wheat flours were subsequently characterized through multivariate data analysis (principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis). Three distinct groups of flour were observed according to the elemental compositions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Papain-like cysteine protease encoding genes in rubber (Hevea
   brasiliensis): comparative genomics, phylogenetic, and transcriptional
   profiling analysis
SO PLANTA
AB 43 HbPLCPs representing nine subfamilies or 20 orthologous groups were found in rubber, where paralogs were resulted from the recent WGD and local duplication. Several senescence-associated genes were also identified.
   Papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) comprise a large family of proteolytic enzymes involved in plant growth and development, seed germination, organ senescence, immunity, and stress response. Despite their importance and the extensive research in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, little information is available on rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), a rubber-producing plant of the Euphorbiaceae family. This study performed a genome-wide identification of PLCP family genes in rubber, resulting in a relatively high number of 43 members. The phylogenetic analysis assigned these genes into nine subfamilies, i.e., RD21 (6), CEP (4), XCP (4), XBCP3 (2), THI (1), SAG12 (18), RD19 (4), ALP (2), and CTB (2). Most of them were shown to have orthologs in Arabidopsis; however, several members in SAG12, CEP and XBCP3 subfamilies form new groups as observed in other core eudicots such as Manihot esculenta, Ricinus communis, Populus trichocarpa, and Vitis vinifera. Based on an expert sequence comparison, 20 orthologous groups (OGs) were proposed for core eudicots, and rubber paralogs were shown to be resulted from the recent whole-genome duplication (WGD) as well as local duplication. Transcriptional profiling showed distinct expression pattern of different members across various tissues, e.g., root, leaf, bark, laticifer, flower, and seed. By using the senescence-specific HbSAG12H1 as the indicator, the transcriptome of senescent rubber leaves was deeply sequenced and several senescence-associated PLCP genes were identified. Results obtained from this study provide valuable information for future functional analysis and utilization of PLCP genes in Hevea and other species.

TI Synthesis of octenylsuccinic-anhydride-modified cassava starch in
   supercritical carbon dioxide
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB The aim of this work was to synthesize octenylsuccinic-anhydride-modified starch (OSAS) via esterification of cassava starch and octenylsuccinic anhydride (OSA) in supercritical carbon dioxide (ScCO2). Using ScCO2 as the medium and hexamethylene as the co-solvent, a reaction efficiency of 84.47% was obtained using 4 wt% OSA. The ester carbonyl groups were successfully introduced into the starch molecule, which was confirmed via FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. In the present study, ScCO2 was an excellent processing aid for the synthesis of OSAS because it could dissolve OSA, allowing the OSA to diffuse into the starch granules. This resulted in esterification occurring on the starch granule surface and in the interior of the starch granule, which led to an even distribution of the substituted groups in the starch granule. As a result, the esterification altered the morphology of the starch granules, and the relative crystallinity of the starch decreased from 36.66 to 30.99% compared to that of cassava starch. Additionally, the OSAS prepared in ScCO2 exhibited a lower gelatinization temperature and a higher peak paste viscosity than the products prepared using a dry method, which indicated that the OSAS prepared in ScCO2 can be used as an effective thickener.

TI Citrate esterified cassava starch: Preparation, physicochemical
   characterisation, and application in dairy beverages
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB This study aimed to produce and characterise citrate esterified resistant starch (RS) from cassava, and apply it in a dairy beverage. The citrate esterified cassava starch (CECS) was prepared by thermo-acid catalysed esterification and the product was characterised for RS content, solubility, swelling power, and water absorption. Scanning electron microscopy, viscoamylographic analysis, X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy were used. The CECS was added to a dairy beverage and then the rheological and sensory characteristics were evaluated. The results showed a 60.08% increase in RS content, revealing the occurrence of fissures and overlapping layers in the starch granules. There was a decrease in solubility, swelling power and water absorption, and formation of ester bonds. The rheological characteristics showed a non-Newtonian pseudoplastic fluid behaviour for the CECS incorporated dairy beverage. The addition of 1.5% CECS to the dairy beverage influenced the colour, taste and consistency, while the addition of 0.5% CECS showed a greater purchase intention, providing an opportunity for development of functional dairy products. In conclusion, this work shows that the developed resistant starch is a promising functional ingredient, with promising applications in the food industry.

TI Impact of additives on mechanical and barrier properties of starch-based
   films plasticized with deep eutectic solvents
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB The aim of this work was to prepare starch-based films plasticized with two and three-component deep eutectic solvents (DES) in the presence of different additives:aluminosilicates (sodium and calcium montmorillonite), microcrystalline cellulose, and tannin; and to investigate their influence on mechanical and barrier properties of the films. Mutual interactions between polysaccharide matrix, plasticizer, and additive were investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Two types of starches were used:native potato starch (TPS) and hydroxypropylated, oxidized potato starch (HOPS). The two-component DES CC:G consisted of choline chloride (CC) and glycerol (G), whereas the three-component DES with crosslinking activity CCit:U:G, included choline citrate (CCit), urea (U), and glycerol. For the TPS/CCit:U:G films an improvement of the mechanical and barrier properties was obtained after introduction of additives, whereas for TPS/CC:G only a slight decrease in water vapor transmission rate was observed, without any significant improvement in mechanical properties. Moreover, the mechanical test results, FTIR spectra, and the oxygen transmission rate values revealed that the clays interacted with plasticizer components, thereby hindering crosslinking reactions between plasticizer and starch.

TI A diagnosis and treatment gap for thiamine deficiency disorders in
   sub-Saharan Africa?
SO ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES
AB Staple diets that are deficient in thiamine can result in low body thiamine levels, which may be subclinical or may manifest as a thiamine-deficiency syndrome. In many communities in the developing countries of Africa, the staple diets of polished rice or processed cassava are deficient in thiamine, and thus the communities are at high risk for marginal or frank thiamine deficiency unless their diets are supplemented by other sources of thiamine, such as protein meals and vegetables. African communities with large numbers of individuals in low socioeconomic strata are more likely to subsist on a monotonous diet of rice or cassava with minimal or no protein supplementation and are therefore particularly at risk of thiamine-deficiency disorders. Indeed, there is evidence of widespread biochemical thiamine deficiency from community-based studies in Africa. The protean manifestations of thiamine deficiency disorders in the developing countries of Africa are presented in this paper. We present evidence supporting the contention that there is a diagnosis and treatment gap for thiamine-deficiency disorders in Africa. We discuss research and clinical options for bridging the putative diagnosis and treatment gap for thiamine-deficiency disorders in the developing countries of Africa.

TI Unexpectedly low biohydrogen yields in co-fermentation of acid
   pretreated cassava residue and swine manure
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Co-fermentation of carbon-rich and nitrogen-rich feedstocks with suitable carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios is commonly considered as a viable way to enhance biological hydrogen production. In this study, cassava residue (C/N ratio = 29.1) and swine manure (C/N ratio = 8.6) were mixed and subject to microwave-assisted acid hydrothermal pretreatment. The resulting hydrolysates were used for subsequent dark hydrogen fermentation. However, the mixture with a C/N ratio of 15.1 resulted in the lowest hydrogen yield potential of 107.8 mL/g volatile solid (VS). Comparatively, the mono-fermentation of cassava residue exhibited the highest hydrogen yield potential of 145.6 mL/g VS and a peak hydrogen production rate of 8.2 mL/g VS/h. The modified Gompertz model was employed for kinetic analysis, and suggested that the lag-phase time and peak time of hydrogen fermentation exhibited a significantly positive linear correlation with increased C/N ratios. Reducing sugars analysis indicated that pretreatment of mixed cassava residue and swine manure led to a decrease of total sugar yield by 7.2-10.5% due to the Maillard reactions between hydrolyzed sugars and amino acids. A reaction mechanism based on glucose and arginine was proposed to elucidate the Maillard interactions between carbonyl group (-C=O) and amino group (-NH2), which was responsible for the overall sugar loss. The findings of this study suggested that pretreatment for mixed carbohydrate-rich and protein-rich feedstocks needs to be optimised to avoid unexpected fermentable sugars loss.

TI Fast pyrolysis of cellulosic ethanol solid residues with high ash and

SO JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS
AB Pyrolysis of corn stalk residue (CSR) and cassava rhizome residue (CRR) to produce bio-oil were investigated using a fluidized bed reactor. Both feedstocks possessed low volatile matters and high ash contents. The results showed that the bio-oil yield of CSR reached the highest value (25.1%) at 700 degrees C, while that of CRR peaked (30.6%) at 600 degrees C. The obtained bio-oils were separated into light fraction and heavy fraction automatically. The light fraction mainly consisted of furan compounds and carboxylic acids, while the heavy fraction mainly consisted of aromatic compounds. Due to the abundant lignin in the residues, high heating values (HHVVs) of the heavy fractions reached 25.5-26.8 MJ/kg which were significantly higher than typical bio-oils.

TI Evidence for mid-Holocene rice domestication in the Americas
SO NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
AB The development of agriculture is one of humankind's most pivotal achievements. Questions about plant domestication and the origins of agriculture have engaged scholars for well over a century, with implications for understanding its legacy on global subsistence strategies, plant distribution, population health and the global methane budget. Rice is one of the most important crops to be domesticated globally, with both Asia (Oryza sativa L.) and Africa (Oryza glaberrima Steud.) discussed as primary centres of domestication. However, until now the pre-Columbian domestication of rice in the Americas has not been documented. Here we document the domestication of Oryza sp. wild rice by the mid-Holocene residents of the Monte Castelo shell mound starting at approximately 4,000 cal.yr BP, evidenced by increasingly larger rice husk phytoliths. Our data provide evidence for the domestication of wild rice in a region of the Amazon that was also probably the cradle of domestication of other major crops such as cassava (Manihot esculent a), peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and chilli pepper (Capsicum sp.). These results underline the role of wetlands as prime habitats for plant domestication worldwide.

TI Genome-Wide Association Mapping of Correlated Traits in Cassava: Dry
   Matter and Total Carotenoid Content
SO PLANT GENOME
AB Cassava is a starchy root crop cultivated in the tropics for fresh consumption and commercial processing. Primary selection objectives in cassava breeding include dry matter content and micronutrient density, particularly provitamin A carotenoids. These traits are negatively correlated in the African germplasm. This study aimed at identifying genetic markers associated with these traits and uncovering whether linkage and/or pleiotropy were responsible for observed negative correlation. A genome-wide association mapping using 672 clones genotyped at 72,279 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci was performed. Root yellowness was used indirectly to assess variation in carotenoid content. Two major loci for root yellowness were identified on chromosome 1 at positions 24.1 and 30.5 Mbp. A single locus for dry matter content that colocated with the 24.1 Mbp peak for carotenoids was identified. Haplotypes at these loci explained 70 and 37% of the phenotypic variability for root yellowness and dry matter content, respectively. Evidence of megabase-scale linkage disequilibrium (LD) around the major loci of the two traits and detection of the major dry matter locus in independent analysis for the white-and yellow-root subpopulations suggests that physical linkage rather that pleiotropy is more likely to be the cause of the negative correlation between the target traits. Moreover, candidate genes for carotenoid (phytoene synthase) and starch biosynthesis (UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and sucrose synthase) occurred in the vicinity of the identified locus at 24.1 Mbp. These findings elucidate the genetic architecture of carotenoids and dry matter in cassava and provide an opportunity to accelerate breeding of these traits.

TI Prospects for Genomic Selection in Cassava Breeding
SO PLANT GENOME
AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a clonally propagated staple food crop in the tropics. Genomic selection (GS) has been implemented at three breeding institutions in Africa to reduce cycle times. Initial studies provided promising estimates of predictive abilities. Here, we expand on previous analyses by assessing the accuracy of seven prediction models for seven traits in three prediction scenarios: cross-validation within populations, cross-population prediction and cross-generation prediction. We also evaluated the impact of increasing the training population (TP) size by phenotyping progenies selected either at random or with a genetic algorithm. Cross-validation results were mostly consistent across programs, with nonadditive models predicting of 10% better on average. Cross-population accuracy was generally low (mean = 0.18) but prediction of cassava mosaic disease increased up to 57% in one Nigerian population when data from another related population were combined. Accuracy across generations was poorer than within-generation accuracy, as expected, but accuracy for dry matter content and mosaic disease severity should be sufficient for rapid-cycling GS. Selection of a prediction model made some difference across generations, but increasing TP size was more important. With a genetic algorithm, selection of one-third of progeny could achieve an accuracy equivalent to phenotyping all progeny. We are in the early stages of GS for this crop but the results are promising for some traits. General guidelines that are emerging are that TPs need to continue to grow but phenotyping can be done on a cleverly selected subset of individuals, reducing the overall phenotyping burden.

TI Identification, Expression, and Functional Analysis of the Fructokinase
   Gene Family in Cassava
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Fructokinase (FRK) proteins play important roles in catalyzing fructose phosphorylation and participate in the carbohydrate metabolism of storage organs in plants. To investigate the roles of FRKs in cassava tuber root development, seven FRK genes (MeFRK1-7) were identified, and MeFRK1-6 were isolated. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the MeFRK family genes can be divided into alpha (MeFRK1, 2, 6, 7) and beta (MeFRK3, 4, 5) groups. All the MeFRK proteins have typical conserved regions and substrate binding residues similar to those of the FRKs. The overall predicted three-dimensional structures of MeFRK1-6 were similar, folding into a catalytic domain and a beta-sheet lid region, forming a substrate binding cleft, which contains many residues involved in the binding to fructose. The gene and the predicted three-dimensional structures of MeFRK3 and MeFRK4 were the most similar. MeFRK1-6 displayed different expression patterns across different tissues, including leaves, stems, tuber roots, flowers, and fruits. In tuber roots, the expressions of MeFRK3 and MeFRK4 were much higher compared to those of the other genes. Notably, the expression of MeFRK3 and MeFRK4 as well as the enzymatic activity of FRK were higher at the initial and early expanding tuber stages and were lower at the later expanding and mature tuber stages. The FRK activity of MeFRK3 and MeFRK4 was identified by the functional complementation of triple mutant yeast cells that were unable to phosphorylate either glucose or fructose. The gene expression and enzymatic activity of MeFRK3 and MeFRK4 suggest that they might be the main enzymes in fructose phosphorylation for regulating the formation of tuber roots and starch accumulation at the tuber root initial and expanding stages.

TI Novel Technological and Management Options for Accelerating
   Transformational Changes in Rice and Livestock Systems
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Agricultural producers grapple with low farm yields and declining ecosystem services within their landscapes. In several instances, agricultural production systems may be considered largely unsustainable in socioeconomic and ecological (resource conservation and use and impact on nature) terms. Novel technological and management options that can serve as vehicles to promote the provision of multiple benefits, including the improvement of smallholder livelihoods, are needed. We call for a paradigm shift to allow designing and implementing agricultural systems that are not only efficient (serving as a means to promote development based on the concept of creating more goods and services while using fewer resources and creating less waste) but can also be considered synergistic (symbiotic relationship between socio-ecological systems) by simultaneously contributing to major objectives of economic, ecological, and social (equity) improvement of agro-ecosystems. These transformations require strategic approaches that are supported by participatory system-level research, experimentation, and innovation. Using data from several studies, we here provide evidence for technological and management options that could be optimized, promoted, and adopted to enable agricultural systems to be efficient, effective, and, indeed, sustainable. Specifically, we present results from a study conducted in Colombia, which demonstrated that, in rice systems, improved water management practices such as Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) reduce methane emissions (similar to 70%). We also show how women can play a key role in AWD adoption. For livestock systems, we present in vitro evidence showing that the use of alternative feed options such as cassava leaves contributes to livestock feed supplementation and could represent a cost-effective approach for reducing enteric methane emissions (22% to 55%). We argue that to design and benefit from sustainable agricultural systems, there is a need for better targeting of interventions that are co-designed, co-evaluated, and co-promoted, with farmers as allies of transformational change (as done in the climate-smart villages), not as recipients of external knowledge. Moreover, for inclusive sustainability that harnesses existing knowledge and influences decision-making processes across scales, there is a need for constant, efficient, effective, and real trans-disciplinary communication and collaboration.

TI Understanding cassava yield response to soil and fertilizer nutrient
   supply in West Africa
SO PLANT AND SOIL
AB Enhanced understanding of plant and nutrient interactions is key to improving yields. We adapted the model for QUantitative Evaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils (QUEFTS) to assess cassava yield response to soil and fertilizer nutrients in West Africa.
   Data from on-station and farmer's field experiments across Togo and Ghana were used.
   Soil nutrient supply ranged from 86 to 177, 18-24 and 70-104 kg ha(-1) of N, P and K, respectively, and induced variable cassava responses to fertilizer application. Considering harvest (HI) in deriving the physiological nutrient use efficiencies for maximum dilution (PhEmax) and for maximum accumulation (PhEmin), which are key QUEFTS parameters, improved model predictions with reduction in normalized root mean square error from 32 to 13% at Davi, (Southern Togo) and from 18 to 13% at Kumasi (Southern Ghana). Model overestimated yields in Nyankpala (Northern Ghana) where drought stress reduced yields. Estimated PhEmin and PhEmax at HI of 0.50 were 41 and 96 kg kg(-1) N, 232 and 589 kg kg(-1) P, and 34 and 160 kg kg(-1) K.
   QUEFTS can be used for site-specific estimates of cassava yield responses to fertilizers under rain-fed conditions in West Africa, provided that yield is primarily constrained by N, P and K supplies, and not by drought or other nutrients.

TI Films from corn, wheat, and rice starch ghost phase fractions display
   overall superior performance than whole starch films
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB In a previous study, gelatinized corn starch dispersions (GSD) containing different (similar to 7-59.6%) ghost phase fractions (GPF), i.e., insoluble amylopectin-rich remnants with glycerol added as plasticizer were cast and dried to obtain films. GPF had both positive and negative effects on the films' properties, but GPF of around 20-30%, provided films with good and balanced overall properties ((elongation-at-break (EB), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), opacity, and water vapor permeability (WVP)). Here, corn, wheat, and rice GSD were prepared containing GPF of 63.6, 61.3, and 58.2%. The GPF was separated from GSD, and films were prepared with solely the GPF and with the whole GSD. Ghost phase fraction films (GPFF) exhibited higher hydrophobicity and EB, lower WVP and retrogradation than those obtained from the whole gelatinized starch dispersion films (GSDF), with only UTS exhibiting lower values. It was postulated that the underlying reason for the improved overall performance displayed by the GPFF was that they practically did not retrograde, due to the depletion of the amylose-rich viscous continuous phase, and that the ghosts played an important role as physical fillers imparting elasticity and as physical barriers hindering the transport of water. The ghosts' particle size and concentration affected the surface morphology, accounting for the differences in properties found between the corn, wheat, and rice GPFF.

TI Evaluation of extraction method on the structure and physicochemical
   properties of starch from seeds of two jackfruit varieties
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB Two main varieties of jackfruit (soft and hard) are commonly known in Brazil and contain a large amount of starch. This work aimed to evaluate the effect of extraction methods (aqueous and alkaline treatments) on the structural and physicochemical properties of starches from soft and hard jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) seeds. The jackfruit seed starch (JSS) granules were small (6.4-11.1 mu m diameter), round, and bell-shaped with a smooth surface. Apparent amylose content ranged from 24 to 32% and was higher for the soft variety, which influenced several properties. The starches exhibited A-type XRD patterns, which contributed to the high peak gelatinization temperatures (72-81 degrees C), and a crystallinity index ranging between 9.3 and 36.9%. Peak viscosities (2362-3373 cP) were similar to cassava starch. However, irrespective of the extraction method, the hard JSS had relatively higher pasting properties (peak viscosity and breakdown), swelling power, and solubility index (90 degrees C) when compared to the soft JSS, which could be associated with the lower amylose content. Significant differences in lipid, protein, and amylose contents were observed in all starches extracted with the NaOH solution. The alkaline solvent decreased the average particle size of JSS by about 36%, probably causing a chemical gelatinization. Additionally, NaOH significantly reduced the crystallinity index and caused minor changes in granule morphology and swelling power.

TI Partial characterization of starches from major banana (matooke)
   cultivars grown in Uganda
SO FOOD SCIENCE & NUTRITION
AB The SEM of starch from five EAHB cultivars showed a mixture of irregular granule shapes with smooth surfaces. The starches' average diameter size ranged between 16.31 and 21.98m. The moisture, protein, and ash content of the starches were: 11.12%-11.84%, 0.1% and 0.23%-0.47% respectively. The amylose content of these starches was between 11% and 13%. The starches peak viscosity ranged between 488.42 and 558.66RVU. The EAHB starches exhibited relatively low pasting temperatures (<75 degrees C), a high peak viscosity (488.42-558.71RVU), high level of viscosity breakdown (235.00-311.92RVU) and low set-back values (61.21-104.33RVU). In general, the EAHB starches' WHCs and SPs increased substantially at 80 degrees C with maximum SP (12.43-14.27g water/g starch) and solubility (12.52%-14.19%) values obtained at 90 degrees C. The starch clarity ranged from 1.7% to 2.3% and followed the same pattern. The starches exhibited poor freeze-thaw stability as they had high syneresis (68% to 72%) after 10 freeze-thaw cycles.

TI Effect of soy protein isolate on the functional, pasting, and sensory
   acceptability of cassava starch-based custard
SO FOOD SCIENCE & NUTRITION
AB Fortification of custard powder (CP) with protein from cheap sources such as soybean could potentially improve its nutritive value but may alter its functional and sensory properties. This study was therefore conducted to determine the effect of soy protein isolate (SPI) inclusion (0%-20%) on some functional and sensory properties of cassava starch-based CP. Functional, pasting, and sensory acceptability were determined using standard methods. Increase in soy protein isolate significantly (p<.05) decreased dispersibility, packed bulk density, swelling power, peak, trough, breakdown, final, and setback viscosities, but increased least gelation concentration, water absorption capacity, and solubility index. This study further showed that despite increasing addition of SPI up to 20%, sensory acceptability of the cassava starch-based CP formulations did not differ significantly, and most of them had very similar acceptability when compared to that of corn starch-based CP.

TI Infectivity of Deinbollia mosaic virus, a novel weed-infecting
   begomovirus in East Africa
SO ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY
AB Weed-infecting begomoviruses play an important role in the epidemiology of crop diseases because they can potentially infect crops and contribute to the genetic diversity of crop-infecting begomoviruses. Despite the important epidemiological role that weed-infecting begomoviruses play, they remain insufficiently studied in Africa. Recently, we identified Deinbollia mosaic virus (DMV), a distinct begomovirus found naturally infecting the weed host Deinbollia borbonica (Sapindaceae) in Kenya and Tanzania. In this study, we investigated the capacity of DMV to infect a restricted host range of Solanaceae and Euphorbiaceae species. Biolistic inoculation of Nicotiana benthamiana with concatemeric DNAs resulted in systemic infection associated with yellow mosaic symptoms, while DNA partial dimers caused asymptomatic systemic infection. DMV was not infectious to cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), suggesting host resistance to the virus. Here, we demonstrate the first experimental infectivity analysis of DMV in N. benthamiana and cassava.

TI Synthesis of eccentric core-shell particles by surfactant-free emulsion
   polymerization with enzymatically hydrolyzed starch as the stabilizer
SO COLLOID AND POLYMER SCIENCE
AB Monodisperse particles with eccentric core-shell structure were prepared via surfactant-free emulsion polymerization (SFEP) using enzymatically hydrolyzed starch (EHS) as stabilizers. A possible mechanism of the particle formation was proposed. The EHS and graft copolymer were characterized by FTIR, size exclusion chromatography, TEM, dynamic laser scattering, DSC, and thermogravimetric analysis. The particle size increased from 148 to 452 nm with the decrease in concentration and molecular weight of EHS. Application of the EHS as the stabilizer for SFEP showed that the EHS effectively stabilized latex particles and produced monodisperse latexes. The TEM and DSC results indicated that the eccentric core-shell particles were obtained and the compatibility of two phases was improved. The EHS content of the copolymer was approximately 15%, determined by the TGA results. This work provided an efficient, cheap, and eco-friendly method to produce monodisperse particles decorated by starch oligo- or polysaccharides.

TI Performance and microbial community structure characterization of a CIC
   anaerobic reactor for the treatment of cassava wastewater
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB A laboratory-scale controlling internal circulation (CIC) anaerobic reactor was developed to treat cassava wastewater. The hydraulic retention time (HRT), internal circulation ratio, and temperature were selected as main operating variables that could be optimized to increase efficiency of the reactor. Responses of microbial communities to changes in these parameters were investigated using high throughput sequencing (HTS) approach. With increasing internal circulation ratio, the COD removal efficiencies and gas production rates also increased. On the other hand, decreasing temperature to 20 degrees C resulted to increase in the effluent COD concentration to 1000 mg L-1, with low gas production rate of 0.10 m(3)CH(4) kg(-1).COD-1. Upon starting the internal circle of the CIC reactor, species diversity was reduced while species abundance increased. Specifically, Methanosarcinales increased from 32.82% to 39.69%, and Methanobacteriales from 33.72% to 54.77%. However, when the CIC reactor temperature was further reduced to 25 degrees C, the abundance of Methanobacteria decreased to 33.35%. Results showed the microbial community shift was observed at different internal circulation ratio and temperature, influencing the pollutants removal rate and gas production rate.

TI Freshwater use analysis of cassava for food feed fuel in the Mun River
   basin, Thailand
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB This research aims to assess the current freshwater use in the cassava supply chain for food, feed fuel in the Mun basin, and the water scarcity impact and possible options to increase cassava production to meet the future demand following the Renewable and Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) target.
   This research analyzes freshwater use based on ISO 14046 water footprint assessment. The analysis was implemented based on a life cycle perspective that determines the impact on freshwater use from cassava products along their supply chain. Both direct water use and indirect water use that associated are analyzed. Midpoint impact of water use was assessed using water stress index (WSI) to calculate water scarcity footprint.
   The results show that in the current situation, total freshwater use of all cassava-related product in Mun basin in the base case is 1140 million m(3)/year. When WSI was applied, water scarcity footprint of all cassava-related products in the Mun basin in the base case was only 147 million m(3)/year. In the scenario 1, increasing irrigation to increase yield in the existing cassava cultivation area in the Mun basin has the largest water use compare to other scenarios. Scenarios 2 and 3, expanding cassava cultivation area in Mun basin and in other regions, have lower water and water scarcity impact than scenario 1. The benefit from transforming paddy rice (in unsuitable areas) to cassava cultivation was also good. However, more resources are required including land, energy, or fertilizer, and other environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emission or eutrophication could be increased from the increasing resource use. Therefore, the decision-making process needs to consider the trade-off between those factors, and a more complete life cycle assessment (LCA) on the envisioned alternatives should be applied for further analysis.
   The increasing demand of biofuels derived from cassava can increase stress on water in the Mun River basin. Increasing irrigation water use in the area as per requirement could possibly increase yield to meet the future feedstock demand but has large water scarcity impact. However, this could be alleviated by using groundwater from additional wells in the farm. Expanding cassava cultivation area could be another option having low water scarcity impact, but it requires more resources and could increase other environmental impacts that need to be further analyzed by a complete LCA.

SO JOURNAL OF ELASTOMERS AND PLASTICS
AB A series of interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels based on cross-linked natural rubber (XNR) and cassava starch (CSt) as biodegradable membrane material were synthesized via free radical polymerization in latex state using N,N-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) and maleic acid as cross-linkers. The IPN XNR/CSt hydrogels were confirmed and characterized by infrared spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and X-ray diffraction. The results showed that with increasing MBA content from 1.0 to 2.5 phr, cross-link density and gel fraction of XNR increased from 0.80 to 0.90 mol M-3 and from 19.7% to 30.5%, respectively. The gel fraction and tensile strength of the IPN XNR/CSt hydrogels also gradually increased as a function of MBA content but the water swelling and elongation at break decreased slightly. The IPN XNR/CSt containing 1.0 phr MBA displayed the highest water swelling of 82%. The weight retentions of IPN XNR/CSt hydrogels after soil degradations for 90 days increased from 48% to 56% with increasing MBA from 1.0 phr to 2.5 phr. The IPN XNR/CSt exhibited not only a good biodegradation but also high mechanical strength and flexibility. Also, the IPN XNR/CSt could be a promising candidate as a biodegradable membrane for longer released fertilizer application.

TI The policy recommendations on cassava ethanol in China: Analyzed from
   the perspective of life cycle "2E & W"
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB The Chinese government has been implementing the policy of encouraging to use ethanol-blended gasoline as fuels. However, the actual application is still facing lots of challenges. In this study, a well-operated cassava ethanol system in China was chosen as the case study to investigate energy consumption, GHGs emission, and water footprints ("2E & W") from the life cycle perspective. The status quo and the evolution of China's policies on bioethanol were also reviewed. Positive net energy value of 13.64 MJ/L ethanol and net GHGs emission of 1473 gCO(2.eq)/L ethanol were found for cassava ethanol, which indicates that it could be an excellent substitute for gasoline. Compared with gasoline, using E10 and E85 could have the potential reduce fossil energy usage and GHG emissions. During its life cycle, ethanol conversion is the most energy-intensive and GHGs-intensive stage. The water footprint of cassava ethanol is 2998 m(3)/tonne. Unlike energy consumption and GHGs, the cassava planting stage is the most water -footprint-intensive stage due to the grey water caused by the fertilizer. The life cycle results of cassava ethanol are sensitive to many factors, such as cassava yield, energy input. Finally, some policy recommendations are provided.

TI Deep Learning for Image-Based Cassava Disease Detection
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Cassava is the third largest source of carbohydrates for human food in the world but is vulnerable to virus diseases, which threaten to destabilize food security in sub-Saharan Africa. Novel methods of cassava disease detection are needed to support improved control which will prevent this crisis. Image recognition offers both a cost effective and scalable technology for disease detection. New deep learning models offer an avenue for this technology to be easily deployed on mobile devices. Using a dataset of cassava disease images taken in the field in Tanzania, we applied transfer learning to train a deep convolutional neural network to identify three diseases and two types of pest damage (or lack thereof). The best trained model accuracies were 98% for brown leaf spot (BLS), 96% for red mite damage (RMD), 95% for green mite damage (GMD), 98% for cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), and 96% for cassava mosaic disease (CMD). The best model achieved an overall accuracy of 93% for data not used in the training process. Our results show that the transfer learning approach for image recognition of field images offers a fast, affordable, and easily deployable strategy for digital plant disease detection.

TI Land fragmentation effects on technical efficiency of cassava farmers in
   South-West geopolitical zone, Nigeria
SO COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB This paper provides regional effects of land fragmentation on technical efficiency of 462 cassava farmers selected through a multitage sampling technique from South-West geopolitical zone of Nigeria. The analysis was based on cassava farmers' 2015/2016 production season data, using the stochastic production frontier model. Mean farm holdings and plots size per farmer in the study area were 2.37 and 1.075 ha respectively. Results show that quantity of labour used, land size and quantity of planting material are influential determinants of technical efficiency of cassava farmers. The result further revealed that fragmentation index and distance between farm and farmstead are the only significant technical inefficiency variables. The study found that substantial technical inefficiency exists in cassava farming. The study recommends land reforms that directly targeted at cassava farmers in form of enhancement progamme to increase their production efficiency.

TI Starch biocomposite film reinforced by multiscale rice husk fiber
SO COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A biodegradable composite and nanocomposite made from cassava starch and rice husk fiber were prepared using the solution-casting method. Cellulose was extracted from the rice husk via chemical treatment and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were isolated via acid hydrolysis. The microstructures, crystalline structures, and thermal, mechanical, and water uptake properties of the biocomposites and nanocomposites were characterized. It was found that the storage modulus, tensile properties, thermal stability of the starch biocomposite (SB)-CNC increased, whereas the water uptake decreased. From the results, it can be concluded that CNC is highly compatible with starch and can reinforce the starch phase to produce green nanocomposite films for use as food packaging films and shopping bags.

TI Efficient CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Editing of Phytoene desaturase in Cassava
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB CRISPR/Cas9 has become a powerful genome-editing tool for introducing genetic changes into crop species. In order to develop capacity for CRISPR/Cas9 technology in the tropical staple cassava (Manihot esculenta), the Phytoene desaturase (MePDS) gene was targeted in two cultivars using constructs carrying gRNAs targeting two sequences within MePDS exon 13. After Agrobacterium-mediated delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents into cassava cells, both constructs induced visible albino phenotypes within cotyledon-stage somatic embryos regenerating on selection medium and the plants regenerated therefrom. A total of 58 (cv. 60444) and 25 (cv. TME 204) plant lines were recovered, of which 38 plant lines (19 from each cultivar) were analyzed for mutagenesis. The frequency of plant lines showing albino phenotype was high, ranging from 90 to 100% in cv. TME 204. Observed albino phenotypes were comprised of full albinos devoid of green tissue and chimeras containing a mixture of white and green tissues. Sequence analysis revealed that 38/38 (100%) of the plant lines examined carried mutations at the targeted MePDS site, with insertions, deletions, and substitutions recorded. One putatively mono-allelic homozygous line (1/19) was found from cv. 60444, while 1 (1/19) and 4 (4/19) putatively bi-allelic homozygous lines were found in 60444 and TME204, respectively. The remaining plant lines, comprised mostly of the chimeras, were found to be putatively heterozygous. We observed minor (1 bp) nucleotide substitutions and or deletions upstream of the 5 0 and or downstream of the 3 0 targeted MePDS region. The data reported demonstrates that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing of cassava is highly efficient and relatively simple, generating multi-allelic mutations in both cultivars studied. Modification of MePDS described here generates visually detectable mutated events in a relatively short time frame of 6-8 weeks, and does not require sequencing to confirm editing at the target. It therefore provides a valuable platform to facilitate rapid assessment and optimization of CRISPR/Cas9 and other genome-editing technologies in cassava.

AB A novel and efficient process for levulinic acid/ester production from non-edible cassava is proposed via a one-pot cascade processes of prehydrolysis and delignification. The intensification effect of monosaccharide formation (prehydrolysis) and the solvent effect for delignification were investigated extensively. The influences of reaction conditions, such as, reaction temperature, time and catalyst concentration, were examined. The results show that prehydrolysis and delignification have significant promotional effects on levulinic acid/ester production. 60.36% levulinic acid/ester yield at a process efficiency of 88.90% can be obtained at 160 degrees C for 3.0 h when cassava is pretreated at 100 degrees C for 1.0 h. However, only 32.18% yield and 46.98% process efficiency are observed without prehydrolysis. Characterization of the starting feedstock and residues using compositional analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analysis demonstrate that efficient lignin removal has a positive influence for levulinic acid/ester formation. Moreover, this process is robust and suitable for scale-up, indicating that it has a great potential for industrial levulinic acid/ester production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Soaking assisted thermal pretreatment of cassava peels wastes for
   fermentable sugar production: Process modelling and optimization
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB This study reports a hybrid pretreatment strategy for optimum fermentable sugar (FS) release from cassava peels waste. The Response Surface design method was used to investigate the effect of soaking temperature, soaking duration, autoclave duration, acid concentration and solid loading on reducing sugar yield. The model gave a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.87. The optimum pretreatment conditions of 69.62 degrees C soaking temperature, 2.57 h soaking duration, 5 min autoclave duration, 3.68 v/v acid concentration and 9.65% w/v solid loading were obtained. Maximum reducing sugar of 89.80 +/- 2.87 g/L corresponding to a fermentable sugar yield of 0.93 +/- 0.03 g/g cassava peels was achieved Upon model validation. A percentage sugar recovery of 90.79% was achieved with a 31% improvement in the FS yield from the enzyme pretreatment. The combined severity factor (CSF) of 0.77 and the low concentration of inhibitory compounds achieved further demonstrates the efficiency of this technique.

TI Characteristics and potential utilizations of starch from pineapple stem
   waste
SO INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB Pineapple stems have become a significant agricultural waste in Thailand because pineapple has to be replanted every two years. However this renewable waste resource can be a good source of starch. This study is aimed to extract and characterize the starch using the common mechanical extraction with water. The physicochemical properties of pineapple stem starch have been investigated and compared with those of some commercial starches from rice, corn and cassava. Pineapple stem starch has unique and distinct properties when compared to the commercial starches. It has the highest amylose content (34.4%), gelatinization temperature (T-o = 82.8 degrees C), gelatinization enthalpy (19.4 J/g) and pasting temperature (90.6 degrees C). However under normal cooking condition, it has the lowest paste viscosity. These potentially beneficial characteristics make pineapple stem starch a good source of resistant and thermoplastic starch for food and non-food applications.

TI Flower-like MoSe2/C Composite with Expanded (002) Planes of Few-layer
   MoSe2 as the Anode for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have caught considerable attention in last few years owing to the abundance of sodium in comparison to lithium. The commercial graphite anode is demonstrated unsuitable as an anode material for SIBs due to the larger radius of Na+ ions, whereas the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) show great potential as anodes for SIBs because of their high achievable capacity. The sluggish kinetics, large volume expansion, and aggregation of those materials however results in severe decay of the electrochemical performance. In this work, a flower-like MoSe2/C composite is synthesized with ethylenediamine and cassava starch (denoted as MoSe2/C-cas) and designed based on these principles: 1) expand the d-spacing of (0 0 2) planes of MoSe2 to enhance the kinetics for the intercalation- deintercalation of Na+ ions and 2) embed MoSe2 into the carbon matrix to enhance the conductivity and restrict the volume expansion and aggregation of MoSe2. As a result, MoSe2/C-cas exhibits superior cycle performance and rate capability for sodium storage. It shows durable long-life cycle capability with a reversible capacity of 360 mAhg(-1) after 350 cycles at 0.5 Ag-1. At the current density of 4 Ag-1, the reversible capacity is still maintained at 266 mAhg(-1).

TI Periclinal chimera technique: new plant breeding approach
SO GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH
AB Plant interspecific periclinal chimeras are a mosaic formed by tissues from two species. They are manipulated here as an efficient plant breeding tool for cassava root yields. In this study, plants synthesized from two chimeras, designated as chimera 2 and chimera 4, were characterized morphologically and cytologically to unravel the origin of their tissue layers (L2 and L3). Root yield of the two chimeras was also evaluated. Chimera 2 that was developed from graft union between Manihot fortalezensis (F) as scion and M. esculenta (E) as rootstock and the same in chimera 4 was developed from grafting triploid cassava cultivar (2n = 54) (C) as scion and M. pohlii (P) (2n = 36) as rootstock. A new method of inducing interspecific chimeras without using hormones was also tested in this study. Five combinations between four cassava cultivars on one side and M. fortalezensis and an interspecific hybrid (M. glaziovii x M. esculenta) on the other side were experimented to determine compatibility between the parents. Wild species always gave L2 and L3, independent of being used as rootstock or scion. L3 is responsible for producing pericycle. Thus, its performance was different in each chimera due to specific epigenetic interaction. Of 48 grafts, it was obtained one chimera giving a percentage of 2.1% that is little lower than using hormones but much efficient to use. Chimera induction efficiency in this investigation was the same when using hormones. Thus, our new, less labor, and more cost-effective technique is as much efficient as hormones and is much potential to employ as an effective plant breeding method boosting cassava root yield.

TI Production of biodegradable starch nanocomposites using cellulose
   nanocrystals extracted from coconut fibers
SO POLIMEROS-CIENCIA E TECNOLOGIA
AB Different polymeric matrices have been investigated for use in the development of biodegradable films. The incorporation of cellulose nanocrystals in such films has particularly attracted attention because of the potential for achieving improved properties of starch nanocomposites. In the present study, cellulose nanocrystals were extracted from coconut fibers and incorporated in cassava and potato starch films at different concentrations. The properties of the different nanobiocomposite films were comparatively evaluated, including their barrier and mechanical properties. All the films, regardless of the nanocrystal concentration, were found to exhibit low solubility in water, with increased moisture content particularly observed in the films with higher nanocrystal concentrations. The potato starch film with the lowest nanocrystal concentration was found to exhibit the best mechanical properties. The observations of this study indicated that the source of the starch and the nanocrystal concentration determined the properties of the nanobiocomposite films.

TI Multiple T-DNA Delivery to Plants Using Novel Mini Binary Vectors with
   Compatible Replication Origins
SO ACS SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
AB Improved plants are necessary to meet human needs. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is the most common method used, to rewire plant capabilities. For plant gene delivery, DNA constructs are assembled into binary T-DNA vectors, that rely on broad host range origins for bacterial replication. Here we present pLX vectors, a set of mini binary T-DNA plasmids suitable for Type ITS restriction endonuclease- and overlap-based assembly methods. pLX vectors include replicons from compatible broad host range plasmids. Simultaneous usage of pBBR1- and RK2-based pLX vectors in a two-plasmid/one Agrobacterium strain strategy allowed multigene delivery to plants. Adoption of pLX vectors will facilitate routine plant transformations and targeted mutagenesis, as well as complex part and circuit characterization.

AB Mealybug is an important pest of cassava plant in Thailand and tropical countries, leading to severe damage of crop yield. One of the most successful controls of mealybug spread is using its natural enemies such as green lacewings, where the development of mathematical models forecasting mealybug population dynamics improves implementation of biological control. In this work, the Sharpe-Lotka-McKendrick equation is extended and combined with an integro-differential equation to study population dynamics of mealybugs (prey) and released green lacewings (predator). Here, an age-dependent formula is employed for mealybug population. The solutions and the stability of the system are considered. The steady age distributions and their bifurcation diagrams are presented. Finally, the threshold of the rate of released green lacewings for mealybug extermination is investigated.

TI Interaction of genotype and environment effects on important traits of
   cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz)
SO CROP JOURNAL
AB General and specific environmental adaptation of genotypes is the main goal of breeders. However, genotype-by-environment (G ? E) interaction complicates the identification of genotypes for release. This study aimed at analyzing the effects of G ? E interaction on the expression of important cassava traits using two multivariate analyses: additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and genotype stability index (GSI). Total carotene content (TCC), postharvest physiological deterioration (PPD), and reaction to viral diseases were significantly affected by G ? E interaction effects. The low percent (%) variation due to genotype for cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) explained the influence of environment on CBSD expression. The % variation due to genotype for TCC was higher (96%) than variation due to environment (1.7%) and G ? E interaction (2.4%) indicating a low interaction effect of environment on TCC accumulation. The % variation due to genotype was higher than % variation due to environment for all traits but CBSD root necrosis and CBSD on stems, indicating the influence of environment on the severity of the viral diseases. These findings indicate that screening for disease resistance requires multi-environment trials, whereas a single-environment trial suffices to screen for total carotene content.

TI Bioplastics of Native Starches Reinforced with Passion Fruit Peel
SO FOOD AND BIOPROCESS TECHNOLOGY
AB Industrial passion fruit juice production generates a large amount of passion fruit waste, which contains about 60% of fibers when dried and could be used as reinforcement of thermoplastic starch. This study aimed to develop an extruded starchy bioplastic reinforced with passion fruit peel (Pfp) (0, 4, 10, 16, and 20%), glycerol (60, 64, 70, 76, and 80 wt%), and starch mix (55% corn and 45% cassava) that were processed at varied screw speeds (66, 80, 100, 120, and 134 rpm). The response surface methodology was applied to analyze the effects of Pfp, glycerol, and screw speed. Mechanical properties, contact angle, and water permeability and solubility were the response variables. Addition of Pfp, up to 4%, improved the bioplastic mechanical properties. High addition of Pfp (16 and 20%) combined with the lowest screw speed (66 rpm) reduced bioplastic water solubility. Water vapor permeability slightly increased with the combination of increasing glycerol content and screw speed. Contact angle was not statically affected by the independent variables. The extrusion showed as an interesting tool that provided greater homogeneity of Pfp incorporated in starch bioplastic, though the mix would benefit from finer Pfp particle size distribution.

TI Cassava starch films containing rosemary nanoparticles produced by
   solvent displacement method
SO FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS
AB Cassava starch films containing rosemary nanoparticles were successfully produced using a simple approach. Different concentrations (5 and 20% w/w) of ethanolic extracts of rosemary were added to the film-forming aqueous blends containing cassava starch and glycerol, and in this way, rosemary nano particles were produced by the solvent displacement. The formulations added of the lowest extract amount led to films containing well distributed rosemary nanoparticles within the matrix. In contrast, higher extract concentration provoked the formation of agglomerates of nanoparticles within the films. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis suggested that the availability of hydroxyl groups within the starch matrix was decreased due to the presence of the rosemary-related compounds. Tensile properties of the cassava starch films were also influenced by the addition of rosemary extract. It was found that the rosemary nanoparticles were able to act as a reinforcement of the starch matrix increasing the elastic modulus and the tensile strength of the films up to 4.0-fold and 2.5 fold, respectively; while the strain at break was slightly decreased, compared with the control films. Finally, the release kinetics of rosemary polyphenols from cassava starch active films to aqueous and fatty food simulants was analyzed. In the aqueous medium, all active films released a polyphenols amount above 60% within the first hour of assay. In contrast, the release rate of rosemary polyphenols into ethanol (i.e. a fatty food simulant) was slower compared with the aqueous one. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Crops that feed the world: Production and improvement of cassava for
   food, feed, and industrial uses
SO FOOD SECURITY
AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is one of the oldest root and tuber crops, used by humans to produce food, feed and beverages. Currently, cassava is produced in more than 100 countries and fulfils the daily caloric demands of millions of people living in tropical America, Africa, and Asia. Its importance as a food security crop is high in Western, Central and Eastern Africa due to its ability to produce reasonable yields (similar to 10 t/ha) in poor soils and with minimal inputs. Traditionally a famine reserve and a subsistence crop, the status of cassava is now evolving fast as a cash crop and as raw material in the production of starch (and starch based products), energy (bio-ethanol) and livestock feed in the major producing countries. Cassava leaves, which are rich in protein and beta-carotenoids, are also used as a vegetable and forage (fresh or dehydrated meal) in various parts of the world. In recent years, some of the problems in the production of cassava have been increasing infection with cassava mosaic disease (CMD), cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) and cassava bacterial blight (CBB). Inherent post-harvest physiological disorder (PPD) and cyanogenic glycosides (CG) are some of the most prominent challenges for scientists, producers and consumers in the post-production systems. Collaborative research in participatory plant breeding is ongoing at leading international research institutes such as IITA and CIAT to improve crop resistance to virus diseases, reduce PPD and CG, and improve the overall nutritional characteristics. Further research should also focus on post-production systems by developing enhanced storage and transportation techniques, mechanisation (peeling, size reduction, drying and dewatering) and improved packaging. Moreover, a robust national policy, market development, and dissemination and extension program are required to realise the full potential of innovations and technologies in cassava production and processing.

TI Morphological and physicochemical characterization of porous starches
   obtained from different botanical sources and amylolytic enzymes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB Porous starches might offer an attractive alternative as bio-adsorbents of a variety of compounds. However, morphology and physicochemical properties of starches must be understood before exploring their applications. Objective was to study the action of different amylolytic enzymes for producing porous starches. Wheat, rice, potato and cassava starches were treated with Amyloglucosidase (AMG), alpha-amylase (AM) and cyclodextrin-glycosyltransferase (CGTase). Morphological characteristics, chemical composition, adsorptive capacity and pasting/thermal properties were assessed. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed porous structures with diverse pore size distribution, which was dependent on the enzyme type and starch source, but no differences were observed in the total granule surface occupied by pores. The adsorptive capacity analysis revealed that modified starches had high water absorptive capacity and showed different oil adsorptive capacity depending on the enzyme type. Amylose content analysis revealed different hydrolysis pattern of the amylases, suggesting that AMG mainly affected crystalline region meanwhile AM and CGTase attacked amorphous area. A heatmap illustrated the diverse pasting properties of the different porous starches, which also showed significant different thermal properties, with different behavior between cereal and tuber starches. Therefore, it is possible to modulate the properties of starches through the use of different enzymes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Mineral and Antinutrient Content of High Quality Cassava-Tigernut
   Composite Flour Extruded Snack
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION
AB This study investigated the mineral and antinutrient composition of extruded snack produced from different blends of high quality cassava and tigernut flour. The extruded snacks were produced using a single-screw laboratory extruder at constant feed moisture (27%), screw speed (60rpm) and barrel temperature (80C). It was observed that the extrudates had higher values for mineral composition (phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium and iron) than the composite flour which showed that extrusion cooking improves the absorption of the minerals. The antinutrient (tannin, phytate, saponin, oxalate, alkaloids and total phenolic) contents of all the flour blends significantly (P<0.05) increased with tigernut flour inclusion. Extrusion cooking resulted in significant (P<0.05) reduction in the antinutrients of the extrudates. The study showed that extrusion cooking reduced the antinutritional factors thereby increasing the bioavailabilty of minerals. Also, the minerals were not affected by the extrusion cooking process probably because minerals are heat stable.
   Practical ApplicationsFindings from this study have potentials to increase the productivity and value addition to tigernut, an underutilized plant specie. The snack produced is also a good alternative gluten free product.

TI Nutritional composition, functional and pasting properties of wheat,
   mushroom, and high quality cassava composite flour
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION
AB Utilization of cheap and readily available staple food products such as high quality cassava flour (HQCF) in substituting more expensive wheat flour is increasing. Mushroom addition can be use to enhance the nutritional value of such food products. Wheat, mushroom, and HQCFs were blended together in 11 different proportions with 100% wheat flour as control. The nutritional and functional qualities of the composite flour samples were determined. Data obtained were subjected to analysis of variance and means separated using Duncan multiple range test. There were significant (p<0.05) differences in the functional properties, chemical and mineral composition of the composite flour samples. Significant (p<0.05) differences were also observed in the pasting profile of the composite flours. Peak, breakdown and trough viscosities increased with increasing HQCF inclusion while the amino acid profile of the flour blends showed significant (p<0.05) difference. Lysine content increased with increasing mushroom inclusion and the dominant fatty acid found was linoleic acid.
   Practical applicationsUse of HQCF for baking application is an emerging nontraditional use of cassava in Nigeria. It is intended to be used as raw material in the food and beverage industry for the manufacture of various ready to eat snack foods and bread. To improve the nutritional properties of the composite flour (wheat with HQCF), an underutilized but readily available protein-rich food commodity (mushroom) was added. The effects of mushroom addition on the nutritional composition, pasting and functional properties of the composite flour were determined.

TI Influence of extrusion process conditions on starch film morphology
SO LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The conditions of extrusion process for food packaging are determinant on their morphology and, as consequence, on their functionality. The effect of the screw speed of a starch-glycerol system extruded at the same temperature profile was evaluated. The process at 80 rpm led to a material with the starch completely gelatinized, while the systems fabricated at 40 rpm and 120 rpm presented broken starch grains. The morphology and density of the broken grains depended on the screw speed. The material at 120 rpm showed broken grains with smaller size and lower concentration than that observed in the system at 40 rpm. After pressing at 120 rpm, the film formed (TPS120) resulted similar than that at 80 rpm (TPS80), while the film at 40 rpm (TPS40) kept some broken grains. TGA of the material obtained at 40 rpm showed more than one degradation process of the glycerol due to the inhomogeneous glycerol dispersion. DRX revealed more cristallinity in TPS40, being TPS120 the most amorphous. TPS80 had the highest strain at break while the others the higher modulus and stress at break. Water vapor permeability of TPS80 and TPS120 showed similar results and lower than TPS40. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI PrLPAAT4, a Putative Lysophosphatidic Acid Acyltransferase from Paeonia
   rockii, Plays an Important Role in Seed Fatty Acid Biosynthesis
SO MOLECULES
AB Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases (LPAATs) are essential for the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and the synthesis of phosphatidic acid (PA), a key intermediate in the synthesis of membrane phospholipids and storage lipids. Here, a putative lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase gene, designated PrLPAAT4, was isolated from seed unsaturated fatty acid (UFA)-rich P. rockii. The complete PrLPAAT4 cDNA contained a 1116-bp open reading frame (ORF), encoding a 42.9 kDa protein with 371 amino acid residues. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that PrLPAAT4 is a plasma membrane protein belonging to acyl-CoA:1-acylglycerol-sn-3-phosphate acyltranferases (AGPAT) family. PrLPAAT4 shared high sequence similarity with its homologs from Citrus clementina, Populus trichocarpa, Manihot esculenta, and Ricinus communis. In Arabidopsis, overexpression of PrLPAAT4 resulted in a significant increase in the content of oleic acid (OA) and total fatty acids (FAs) in seeds. AtDGAT1, AtGPAT9, and AtOleosin, involved in TAG assembly, were upregulated in PrLPAAT4-overexpressing lines. These results indicated that PrLPAAT4 functions may be as a positive regulator in seed FA biosynthesis.

TI Evaluation of the distribution of cyanide in the peels, pulps and leaves
   of three new yellow cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) varieties for
   potential livestock feeds
SO PROGRESS IN NUTRITION
AB The total and free cyanide levels in fresh peels, pulps and leaves of three cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) varieties: TMS 01/1368 (UMUCASS 36), TMS 01/1412 (UMUCASS 37) and TMS 01/1371 (UMUCASS 38) were determined using standard enzymatic methods. Results showed that the total cyanide levels in the peels, pulps and leaves of these cassava varieties were lower than the reference range for fresh cassava peels, pulps and leaves which were given as 364.2 to 814.70 for the peels, 34.3 to 301.30 for the pulps and 200 to 800 mgkg(-1) CN- for the leaves respectively. The cyanide levels in the peels, pulps and leaves of TMS 01/1412 were found to be lower than that of TMS 01/1368, TMS 01/1371 and the reference range. Furthermore, the peels had the highest levels of total and free cyanide followed by the leaves and lastly the pulp. Results obtained from this study indicate the usefulness of the peels, pulps and leaves of these cassava varieties as potential livestock feeds. Finally, results obtained suggest that these cassava byproducts may require simpler processing compared with byproducts of high cyanide cassava varieties before being converted into livestock feeds.

TI CARBON SOURCES AND C:N RATIOS ON WATER QUALITY FOR NILE TILAPIA FARMING
   IN BIOFLOC SYSTEM
SO REVISTA CAATINGA
AB The use of biofloc technology (BFT) can improve fish production in regions with low water availability. Therefore, information on dynamics of water quality is essential for success in fish rearing. Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the water quality for Nile tilapia farming in a system without water exchange, during the fingerling stage, using different sources of carbon and C:N ratios. A completely randomized experimental design was used in a 2x3 factorial arrangement, with two carbon (C) to nitrogen (N) ratios (10:1 and 20:1) and three carbon sources (sugar, molasses and cassava starch). The C: N ratio and carbon source affected the variables alkalinity, settleable solids (SS), turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS), showing significantly higher values at C: N ratio of 20: 1 (P < 0.05). The best carbon source for microbial floc formation were the molasses and sugar, under C: N ratios of 10:1 and 20:1. The stability of the monitored water quality parameters occurred from 6 to 7 weeks of rearing. The growth performance of Nile tilapia in BFT system fertilized with different organic carbon sources was not significantly different (P < 0.05) between treatments. The use of molasses to fertilize BFT systems can reduce costs of production in regions where this product is available.

TI Molecular analysis of the expression of a crtB transgene and the
   endogenous psy2-y (1) and psy2-y (2) genes of cassava and their effect
   on root carotenoid content
SO TRANSGENIC RESEARCH
AB A conventional breeding program was established to transfer the bacterial phytoene synthase transgene-crtB-from a transgenic, white-rooted cassava to yellow-rooted cassava plants carrying the endogenous phytoene synthase alleles named psy2-y (1) and/or psy2-y (2). Combining endogenous phytoene synthase enzymes (PSYs) with CRTB in a single cassava plant would allow the molecular dissection of individual allele contributions to carotenoid synthesis and/or accumulation in cassava roots. The simultaneous expression of the crtB transgene and psy2-y (2) in individuals planted in the field coincided with higher total, HPLC-quantified carotenoid content in roots, although the variability among replications (plants) precluded the detection of statistically significant differences. Nevertheless, the highest total carotenoid content in roots within a family coincided with one individual of the F1 progeny carrying both psy2-y (2) and crtB genes. The results also indicated the presence of at least one more key gene-different from psy or crtB-which too is necessary for the synthesis and/or accumulation of Pro-Vitamin A carotenoids in cassava roots.

TI Catalytic Conversion of Cassava Residues to Ethylene Glycol Via a
   One-Pot Hydrothermal Reaction
SO WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION
AB Cassava residue was proposed as a raw material for the production of ethylene glycol (EG) via a one-pot hydrothermal reaction in the present study. Various mixed catalysts consisting of activated carbon supported Ru (Ru/AC) and a tungsten species were used for the conversion of cassava residues, and the effects of various reaction conditions on the catalytic performance were investigated. When the reaction was carried out at 245 A degrees C for 60 min, the Ru/AC-H2WO4 mixed catalyst showed a EG yield of 53.1 % with a total polyols yield of 80 %, which was confirmed to be the most active among the prepared catalysts. The excellent catalytic performance using cassava residue as the feedstock mainly resulted from a high content of carbohydrates and a low amount of lignin in cassava residues. Furthermore, the Ru/AC-H2WO4 catalyst also showed reasonable stability during the hydrothermal conversion of cassava residues for EG production.

TI Phenotypic stability in cassava estimated by the AMMI analysis with
   supplementary genotypes
SO CROP BREEDING AND APPLIED BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Adaptability is the yield response of cassava genotypes to environmental improvement, and stability is the predictability of this response to variations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the yield stability and adaptability of cassava varieties and clones using the AMMI (Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction) methodology and auxiliary tools as supplementary genotype and environment. The responses of 24 cassava genotypes were evaluated in three environments located in the state of Alagoas, Brazil, in randomized blocks design, with 24 treatments and three replications. The effects of genotype and genotype x environment interactions significantly influenced yield. Genotypes differed regarding the adaptability and stability of yield response, and the varieties Cria Menino and Preta do Araripe were considered ideal genotypes due to high adaptability and yield stability. Among the three tested environments, Limoeiro de Anadia was the best since it presented high yield, phenotypically stable genotypes for cassava breeding programs.

TI Co-Evolution and Bio-Social Construction: The Kichwa Agroforestry
   Systems (Chakras) in the Ecuadorian Amazonia
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Polycultured agrarian systems in Ecuadorian Amazonia (also called chakras or swollen gardens) are characterised by a market-oriented crop for the generation of monetary income, for example, cocoa, other agricultural products (e.g., banana and cassava), and livestock for family farm consumption. Moreover, a chakra is an outstanding example of agroforestry production, in which ecological, social and economic elements co-evolve from a set of close and strong connections. In this context, the conservation and transformation of their biological subsystems can be understood as the result of complex interactions between anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic factors. In turn, such interactions are essential to provide food and monetary income to the indigenous community. Relevant agency capabilities exist that could cause an agroforestry system to take a different path of co-evolution, that is, towards greater or lesser sustainability associated with different levels of complexity. In conclusion, chakras have key ecological features that can mitigate the impact of human population growth in Amazonia. Additionally, chakras have their own processes of social self-regulation which enhance the possibilities of adaptation of Kichwa communities to changing environmental conditions, being essential elements in local food sovereignty, equitable gender relations and the respect of ancestral wisdom.

TI Utilization of engineered resistance to viruses in crops of the

SO CURRENT OPINION IN VIROLOGY
AB Viral diseases in crop plants constitute a major obstacle to food security in the developing world. Subsistence crops, including cassava, sweetpotato, potato, banana, papaya, common bean, rice and maize are often infected with RNA and/or DNA viruses that cannot be controlled with pesticides. Hence, healthy planting materials and virus-resistant cultivars are essential for high yields of good quality. However, resistance genes are not available for all viral diseases of crop plants. Therefore, virus resistance engineered in plants using modern biotechnology methods is an important addition to the crop production toolbox.

SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
AB This study aimed to evaluate the effect of applying increasing doses of biofertilizer obtained by the anaerobic digestion of cassava effluent on the development of crambe plants. The experiment was conducted in a protected environment at the Federal University of Parana (UFPR), Palotina Sector, between April and August 2015. A completely randomized design was used, and five different treatments with the following doses were applied in five replicates: 0, 40, 80, 120, and 160 kg ha(-1) of K2O. The following parameters related to plant development were evaluated: final height, stem diameter, number of branches, dry shoot and root biomass, mass of the grains, and oil content. The 160 kg K2O ha(-1) dose was found to have the best influence on the plant development, because all the measured parameters reached their highest values at this dose, except for oil content, which attained the highest percentage in the case of the control treatment (0 kg ha(-1) of K2O). This study proved that the biofertilizer obtained by anaerobic digestion of cassava effluent can be used as an alternative to regular fertilizers in cultivating crambe.

TI Carbon footprint in the ethanol feedstocks cultivation - Agricultural
   CO2 emission assessment
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB CO2 emission is a current global concern and has progressively increased due fossil fuel use, leading to climatic changes. As a workaround to this problem low carbon fuel use has been the key to mitigate it in several countries. Brazil is a leader in ethanol sugarcane production and has a high demand expected for this biofuel, which means that large areas will be cultivated to supply this demand. Although biofuels help to reduce carbon emissions, agriculture is highlighted in the emission of CO2 to the atmosphere as from the soil. Considering that the amount of soil carbon lost to the atmosphere is tightly coupled to the vegetation type, soil properties and climate conditions, the main objective of this study was to estimate and compare the CO2 emission in the agricultural phase of ethanol production, as from its main feedstocks. A model based on carbon flux of the soil plant-atmosphere system, was used. From the five crops assessed (sugarcane, sugar-beet, corn, rice and cassava), sugarcane and corn crops presented, the less CO2 emission at nowadays and over the next 30 years, in opposite of the sugar-beet crop, which was the less sustainable feedstock for ethanol production in terms of CO2 emission. The outcomes of this study contribute to develop scenarios to better understand the impact of ethanol production in the GEES emission, both in nowadays and in the future, considering the increasing demand for biofuel. Also is presented in this study a detailed discussion regarding important environmental issues of sugarcane and corn ethanol production, which are essential to be considered in the ethanol-policy decision. To our knowledge this is the first study that compares the CO2 emitted from the main ethanol feedstocks based on field tests, under the same conditions of soil and climate.

TI Production and quality evaluation of extruded snack from blends of
   bambara groundnut flour, cassava starch, and corn bran flour
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION
AB Protein dense, fiber-rich extruded snacks were produced from blend of bambara groundnut flour, cassava starch, and corn bran flour using a single screw cooking extruder. The snacks were analyzed for their physical properties and proximate composition using standard laboratory procedures. The expansion ratio, specific volume, breaking force, and breaking strength index (BSI) of the snacks ranged from 0.85 to 1.22, 0.75 to 1.30g/cm(3), 3.95 to 36.45N, and 0.99 to 9.11N/mm, respectively. The breaking force and BSI were high and increased at increasing levels of cassava starch and corn bran inclusion. Moisture, protein, fat, carbohydrates, crude fiber, and total dietary fiber contents of the snacks were 5.40-10.80, 3.26-17.62, 0.68-10.35%, 60.56-85.03, 0.32-4.78, and 7.36-28.74%, respectively. The study revealed a great potential of obtaining a nutrient dense extruded snack from underutilized plant commodity (bambara groundnut) and waste from corn milling (corn bran).
   Practical applicationsFindings from this study will find numerous applications in gluten-free products. It is also capable of enhancing the productivity and utilization of bambara groundnut (an underutilized nutritious legume). The study also attempted to add value to waste product of corn milling (corn bran).

SO JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-MYSORE
AB A completely randomized 2(3) factorial experimental design was used to optimize the process parameters for obtaining tucupi powder through spray drying. The effects of the process variables [inlet air temperature (IT), feed flow rate (FR), and maltodextrin concentration (MD)] on the product properties [moisture, water activity (a(w)), hygroscopicity, water absorption index (WAI), water solubility index (WSI), total color difference (Delta E*), and beta-carotene content] were studied using the response surface methodology (RSM) and linear perturbation plot. In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained of the product. According to ANOVA and the regression coefficients (R-2 > 0.90), the RSM models were significant and IT was the variable with the greatest impact on most of the responses. SEM shows that the powders obtained with higher IT and MD and lower FR were more uniform, with smooth and intact surfaces. The optimal conditions estimated for the process were IT at 214 A degrees C, FR at 8.67 mL/min, and MD at 27%. Under those conditions, the product's minimum values of moisture (9.56 g/100 g), a(w) (0.101), hygroscopicity (37.45% d.b.), and Delta E* (17.05) and maximum values of WAI (6.68 g/g d.b.), WSI (84.77%), and beta-carotene (13.72 A mu g/g) were estimated.

SO NEUROLOGIA
AB Introduction: This study evaluated the protective effects of 2 commercial formats of Ginkgo biloba on motor alterations induced by cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) juice consumption in male Wistar rats.
   Methods: The effects were evaluated with the open field and swim tests at 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of treatment, one hour after administering the product.
   Results: Compared to controls, open field crossings increased after day 21 of cassava juice consumption, and lateral swimming in the swim test was reported after day 7.
   Conclusion: Ginkgo biloba extracts prevented motor alterations associated with cassava juice consumption, probably due to the flavonoid content in both formats of Ginkgo biloba. (C) 2016 Sociedad Espanola de Neurologia. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

TI QTL associated with resistance to cassava brown streak and cassava
   mosaic diseases in a bi-parental cross of two Tanzanian farmer
   varieties, Namikonga and Albert
SO THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS
AB QTL consistent across seasons were detected for resistance to cassava brown streak disease induced root necrosis and foliar symptoms. The CMD2 locus was detected in an East African landrace, and comprised two QTL.
   Cassava production in Africa is compromised by cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) and cassava mosaic disease (CMD). To reduce costs and increase the precision of resistance breeding, a QTL study was conducted to identify molecular markers linked to resistance against these diseases. A bi-parental F-1 mapping population was developed from a cross between the Tanzanian farmer varieties, Namikonga and Albert. A one-step genetic linkage map comprising 943 SNP markers and 18 linkage groups spanning 1776.2 cM was generated. Phenotypic data from 240 F-1 progeny were obtained from two disease hotspots in Tanzania, over two successive seasons, 2013 and 2014. Two consistent QTLs linked to resistance to CBSD-induced root necrosis were identified in Namikonga on chromosomes II (qCBSDRNFc2Nm) and XI (qCBSDRNc11Nm) and a putative QTL on chromosome XVIII (qCBSDRNc18Nm). qCBSDRNFc2Nm was identified at Naliendele in both seasons. The same QTL was also associated with CBSD foliar resistance. qCBSDRNc11Nm was identified at Chambezi in both seasons, and was characterized by three peaks, spanning a distance of 253 kb. Twenty-seven genes were identified within this region including two LRR proteins and a signal recognition particle. In addition, two highly significant CMD resistance QTL (qCMDc12.1A and qCMDc12.2A) were detected in Albert, on chromosome 12. Both qCMDc12.1A and qCMDc12.2A lay within the range of markers reported earlier, defining the CMD2 locus. This is the first time that two loci have been identified within the CMD2 QTL, and in germplasm of apparent East African origin. Additional QTLs with minor effects on CBSD and CMD resistance were also identified.

TI Candidate gene sequencing and validation of SNP markers linked to
   carotenoid content in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz)
SO MOLECULAR BREEDING
AB Cassava is a widely grown staple in Sub-Saharan Africa and consumed as a cheap source of calories, but the crop is deficient in micronutrients including pro-vitamin A carotenoids. This challenge is currently being addressed through biofortification breeding that relies on phenotypic selection. Gene-based markers linked to pro-vitamin A content variation are expected to increase the rate of genetic gain for this critical trait. We sequenced four candidate carotenoid genes from 167 cassava accessions representing the diversity of elite breeder lines from IITA. Total carotenoid content was determined using spectrophotometer and total beta-carotene was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Storage root yellowness due to carotenoid pigmentation was assessed. We carried out candidate gene association analysis that accounts for population structure and kinship using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated through genotyping-by-sequencing. Significant SNPs were used to design competitive allele-specific PCR assays and validated on the larger population for potential use in marker-assisted selection breeding. Candidate gene sequencing of the genes beta-carotene hydroxylase (crtRB), phytoene synthase (PSY2), lycopene epsilon cyclase (lcyE), and lycopene beta cyclase (lcyB) yielded a total of 37 SNPs. Total carotenoid content, total beta-carotene, and color parameters were significantly associated with markers in the PSY2 gene. The SNPs from lcyE were significantly associated with color while those of lcyB and crtRB were not significantly associated with carotenoids or color parameters. These validated and breeder-friendly markers have potential to enhance the efficiency of selection for high beta-carotene cassava, thus accelerating genetic gain.

TI Preparation and properties of microcrystalline cellulose/hydroxypropyl
   starch composite films
SO CELLULOSE
AB In this paper, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC)/hydroxypropyl starch (HPS) composite films are prepared by the solution casting method, and the effect of different amounts of microcrystalline cellulose on the properties of the films is investigated. The structure of MCC/HPS composite materials is characterized by Fourier transform infra-red and scanning election microscopy, and thermal stability, mechanical properties, hygroscopicity, and water vapor permeability of the composite films are also tested. According to the test results, with increasing MCC amounts, glass transition temperature, thermal stability, and tensile strength of MCC/HPS composite films are improved, while the hygroscopicity and water vapor permeability of MCC/HPS composite materials are decreased. When the content of MCC reaches 6 wt%, the maximum increase of the glass transition temperature is about 9.63 A degrees C, and the tensile strength of MCC/HPS composite films are increased by 300% compared with that of HPS films. Moreover, the addition of MCC helps to expand the application of hydroxypropyl starch in the packaging field.

TI A Risk Assessment Framework for Seed Degeneration: Informing an
   Integrated Seed Health Strategy for Vegetatively Propagated Crops
SO PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB Pathogen buildup in vegetative planting material, termed seed degeneration, is a major problem in many low-income countries. When smallholder farmers use seed produced on-farm or acquired outside certified programs, it is often infected. We introduce a risk assessment framework for seed degeneration, evaluating the relative performance of individual and combined components of an integrated seed health strategy. The frequency distribution of management performance outcomes was evaluated for models incorporating biological and environmental heterogeneity, with the following results. (1) On-farm seed selection can perform as well as certified seed, if the rate of success in selecting healthy plants for seed production is high; (2) when choosing among within-season management strategies, external inoculum can determine the relative usefulness of 'incidence-altering management' (affecting the proportion of diseased plants/seeds) and 'rate-altering management' (affecting the rate of disease transmission in the field); (3) under severe disease scenarios, where it is difficult to implement management components at high levels of effectiveness, combining management components can be synergistic and keep seed degeneration below a threshold; (4) combining management components can also close the yield gap between average and worst-case scenarios. We also illustrate the potential for expert elicitation to provide parameter estimates when empirical data are unavailable.

TI Spatial Analysis of Temporal Changes in the Pandemic of Severe Cassava
   Mosaic Disease in Northwestern Tanzania
SO PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB To improve understanding of the dynamics of the cassava mosaic disease (CMD) pandemic front, geospatial approaches were applied to the analysis of 3 years' data obtained from a 2-by-2 (approximately 222-by-222 km) area of northwestern Tanzania. In total, 80 farmers' fields were assessed in each of 2009, 2010, and 2011, with 20 evenly distributed fields per 1-by-1 quadrant. CMD-associated variables (CMD incidence, CMD severity, vector-borne CMD infection, and vector abundance) increased in magnitude from 2009 to 2010 but showed little change from 2010 to 2011. Increases occurred primarily in the two westernmost quadrants of the study area. A pandemic "front" was defined by determining the values of CMD incidence and whitefly abundance where predicted disease gradients were greatest. The pandemic-associated virus (East African cassava mosaic virus-Uganda) and vector genotype (Bemisia tabaci sub-Saharan Africa 1 subgroup 1) were both present within the area bounded by the CMD incidence front but both also occurred ahead of the front. The average speed and direction of movement of the CMD incidence front (22.9 km/year; southeast) and whitefly abundance front (46.6 km/year; southeast) were calculated, and production losses due to CMD were estimated to range from US$4.3 million to 12.2 million.

TI Resistance Genes in Global Crop Breeding Networks
SO PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB Resistance genes are a major tool for managing crop diseases. The networks of crop breeders who exchange resistance genes and deploy them in varieties help to determine the global landscape of resistance and epidemics, an important system for maintaining food security. These networks function as a complex adaptive system, with associated strengths and vulnerabilities, and implications for policies to support resistance gene deployment strategies. Extensions of epidemic network analysis can be used to evaluate the multilayer agricultural networks that support and influence crop breeding networks. Here, we evaluate the general structure of crop breeding networks for cassava, potato, rice, and wheat. All four are clustered due to phytosanitary and intellectual property regulations, and linked through CGIAR hubs. Cassava networks primarily include public breeding groups, whereas others are more mixed. These systems must adapt to global change in climate and land use, the emergence of new diseases, and disruptive breeding technologies. Research priorities to support policy include how best to maintain both diversity and redundancy in the roles played by individual crop breeding groups (public versus private and global versus local), and how best to manage connectivity to optimize resistance gene deployment while avoiding risks to the useful life of resistance genes.

TI GROWTH AND SEED YIELD OF SUNFLOWER ON SOIL FERTILIZED WITH CASSAVA
   WASTEWATER
SO REVISTA CAATINGA
AB Cassava wastewater is the liquid residue of the cassava flour processing and its application to the soil as fertilizer for agricultural crops is a good alternative to sources of nutrients for plants. In this context, the objective of this work was to evaluate the growth and seed yield of sunflower on soil fertilized with cassava wastewater. A randomized block experimental design with four replications was used, with six cassava wastewater rates (0, 8.5, 17, 34, 68 and 136 m(3) ha(-1)) and six plant sampling times (15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 days after sowing), using the sunflower cultivar Helio-250. The evaluated variables were total leaf area, leaf area index, leaf area ratio, specific leaf area, leaf weight ratio, shoot dry mass and sunflower seed yield. The use of cassava wastewater rate of 136 m(3) ha(-1) increases the seed yield, leaf area, leaf area index and shoot dry mass, and results in lower leaf area ratio, specific leaf area and leaf weight ratio of sunflower (cv. Helio-250) crops.

TI Effect of modification with 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme on the
   rheological properties of cassava starch
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB Steady and dynamic shear measurements were used to investigate the rheological properties of cassava starches modified using the 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme (GBE) from Geobacillus thermoglucosidans STB02. GBE treatment lowered the hysteresis loop areas, the activation energy (Ea) values and the parameters in rheological models of cassava starch pastes. Moreover, GBE treatment increased its storage (G') and loss (G") moduli, and decreased their tan delta (ratio of G"/G') values and frequency-dependencies. Scanning electron microscopic studies showed the selective and particular attack of GBE on starch granules, and X-ray diffraction analyses showed that GBE treatment produces significant structural changes in amylose and amylopectin. These changes demonstrate that GBE modification produces cassava starch with a more structured network and improved stability towards mechanical processing. Differential scanning calorimetric analysis and temperature sweeps indicated greater resistance to granule rupture, higher gel rigidity, and a large decrease in the rate of initial conformational ordering with increasing GBE treatment time. Pronounced changes in rheological parameters revealed that GBE modification enhances the stability of cassava starch and its applicability in the food processing industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Salinity reduces carbon assimilation and the harvest index of cassava
   plants (Manihot esculenta Crantz)
SO ACTA SCIENTIARUM-AGRONOMY
AB This study was developed to evaluate the effects of salinity on the growth and gas exchange of cassava plants, cultivar Verdinha. The four concentrations of NaCl (mM) were as follows: 0, 20, 40, and 60. Under salinity, the lowest concentration of Na+ ions was observed in the tuberous roots; however, the dry matter of tuberous roots was reduced with an application of just 20 mM NaCl. The harvest index was reduced 50% with the highest salt concentration. Salinity reduced carbon assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (g(s)), transpiration, and the instantaneous water use efficiency. The correlation between gs and A was high and positive, showing that stomatal movement was one of the responsible for the lower A. Under salt stress, there was an increase in intercellular CO2 concentration, indicating the impairment of carbon metabolism. Based on the reduction of dry matter of the tuberous roots (reduction of 81% under 60 mM NaCl), it was concluded that cassava is sensitive to salinity. The growth of shoots and the absorbing roots were minimally affected by salinity, even in the situation where A was reduced; therefore, the sensitivity of cassava was related to the high sensitivity of the tuberous roots to the ionic and/or osmotic effects of salinity. Thus, tuberous roots can be the target organ in studies that aim to improve the tolerance of cassava to salinity.

The experiment was carried out in 2012, in a randomised block design and an arrangement of lots split over time. A 3 x 2 factorial scheme was used for the lots, consisting of fruit with no wrapping and fruit wrapped in 10 and 16 mu m polyethylene film, and two cultivars, Caipira and Pakovan Ken. The sub-lots consisted of evaluations made at intervals of six days (0, 6, 12, 18 and 24) and of two days (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8), for fruit stored at temperatures of 12, 15 and 25 degrees C respectively. The following variables were evaluated: soluble solids, titratable acidity, ratio of soluble solids to titratable acidity, hydrogen potential, total soluble sugars, fruit colouration and sensory analysis. The polyethylene film together with the refrigeration enabled the fruit to be stored for 24 days, maintaining post-harvest characteristics suitable for consumption. The Pakovan Ken cultivar stood out when compared to the Caipira, with higher values for the fruit attributes under evaluation.

SO REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA
AB The goal of the study was to test the effects of combined weeding and gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) intercropping for weed control in baby corn and green corn production. A completely randomized block design was employed, with split-plot and four replicates. Hybrids AG 1051 and BR 205 were subjected to the following treatments: A = two hoeings, 20 and 40 days after sowing (DAS); B = hoeing at 20 DAS + gliricidia intercropping following weeding; C = gliricidia intercropping established at the moment of corn sowing (GICS) + hoeing at 40 DAS; D = GICS; E = no weeding. Gliricidia was broadcast sown with 30 viable seeds m(-2). The best treatments follow the order A > B > C as number of ears, fresh mass of ears with husks, fresh and dry masses of ears without husks for baby corn, and number of ears, fresh mass of ears with husks, fresh and dry masses of ears without husks for green corn. The worst results are observed for treatments D and E. Treatment D is only better than treatment E for the number of marketable ears without husks. No differences in the yields of immature ears exist between the hybrids.

SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB In this study groundnut shells and bagasse briquettes from agricultural wastes were developed with cassava and wheat starch binders using low pressure and high pressure techniques. In the low pressure technique, briquettes were produced after carbonization of groundnut shells and bagasse. The resulting bio-char was mixed with 30, 50, 70 and 90 g of cassava and wheat flour starch binder for each 1000 g of groundnut shells and bagasse bio-char. Groundnut shell briquettes were also developed under high pressure (230 MPa) using groundnut shells (1000 g) without a binder, groundnut shells (1000 g) with cassava flour starch binder (250 g) and groundnut shells with wheat flour starch binder (250 g). Thermo physical properties of the briquettes were determined using thermo-gravimetric analysis. A Bomb calorimeter was used to determine the higher heating values of the briquettes. Thermal characteristics were determined by observing the flame temperature during combustion. The mechanical integrity of the briquettes was determined using the drop test method. The higher heating values for groundnut shell and bagasse briquettes developed using low pressure techniques were between 21 and 23 MJ/kg for both cassava and wheat starch binders. The results were all above the 16 MJ/kg average recorded for non carbonized groundnut shell briquettes developed under high pressure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Carotenoid retention in biofortified maize using different post-harvest
   storage and packaging methods
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB Orange maize is being promoted as a source of provitamin A carotenoids (pVAC) in Zambia. Carotenoid retention in orange maize grains stored in metal silos, multilayer polyethylene and common woven bags, and maize meal packaged in single and multilayer polyethylene bags was evaluated. Significant differences in total pVAC retention were found between grain storage methods (48.1-57.2%) after 6 months of storage. Total pVAC retention in hammer meal (73.1-73.5%) was higher than in breakfast meal (64.3-69.3%) after 4 months of storage; however, no differences in pVAC retention were found between meal types when stored in single and multilayer polyethylene bags. In general, beta-cryptoxanthin (beta CX) had higher retention than beta-carotene (beta C). Potential contribution of stored orange maize to the estimated average requirement of children and women was 26.5% and 24.3%, respectively. Orange maize meal can provide significant amounts of provitamin A to diets of Zambians even after 4 months of storage. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO COGENT CHEMISTRY
AB Some individuals are intolerant to gluten of wheat and other cereals like oats, rye and barley used for food formulations and this intolerance seriously impairs intestinal absorption. There is need to develop alternative gluten-free flours for baking and confectioneries. This research therefore aimed at determining the chemical and functional properties of plantain-tiger nut composite flour to be able to explore its potentials in food formulation. The flours made from matured plantains and tiger nuts were blended at the ratio of 100:0, 70:30, 60:40, 50:50, 40:60, 30:70 and 0:100 to make different plantain-tiger nuts flours and these were analysed using standard methods. The results revealed that protein ranged from 4.55 to 6.78/100 g, fat (2.25-32.75/100 g), crude fibre (3.50-6.13/100 g), bulk density (0.81-0.92 g/cm(3)), swelling power (38.38-2.37/g), Mg (30.65-49.08 mg/100 g), P (3.65-120.65 mg/100 g), K (71.62-212.08 mg/100 g), Vitamin C (3.18-5.30 mg/100 g) and Vitamin A (1.71-51.31 mu g/100 g). There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the pasting profile of the plantain-tiger nut flour blends and in functional properties of composite flour except for bulk density. Addition of tiger nut flour improved the proximate, mineral and vitamin composition of the composite flour and the study concluded that inclusion of tiger nut flour is a good protein, fat, mineral and vitamin supplement for plantain flour.

TI Ecological analysis of hydrogen production via biogas steam reforming
   from cassava flour processing wastewater
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The use of bioenergy has turned into a good alternative for reducing the emission of pollutant gases. In Brazil, this sort of energy has increased in usage during the last years. Biohydrogen, produced from cassava, appears as an alternative fuel to fossil fuels and, also, becomes economically competitive, since this is a low cost carbon source. The repertoire of results about the ecological impact from the production of bioenergy from cassava wastewater is very limited because, in general, this commodity is more common in underdeveloped countries. This paper evaluates and quantifies the environmental impact of electricity production in a cassava wastewater treatment plant. The ecological efficiency methodology developed by Cardu and Baica [Regarding a new variant methodology to estimate globally the ecologic impact of thermopower plants. Energy conversion and management 40, no. 14 (1999): 1569-1575] is used as a benchmark in this study. The methodology mainly assesses the emissions of equivalent carbon dioxide (CO2, SOx, CH4 and particulate matter), pollutant indicators and ecological effects of a cassava wastewater plant utilizing biohydrogen as energetic carrier. As a result some environmental parameters, such as equivalent carbon dioxide emissions, pollutant indicator and ecological efficiency are evaluated due to the fact that they are important to electricity production. In this way, the environmental parameters was calculated to evaluate how interesting is the process from the environmental feasibility point of view. The average values of the environmental parameters among different biogas compositions was calculated, the average pollution indicator was 10.11 kgCO(2)e/kgH(2) with an average ecological efficiency of 93.37%. As a conclusion, bioenergy production using biohydrogen from cassava wastewater treatment plant can be justified by the determination of environmental parameters, allowing innovation for producing energy from a cassava wastewater treatment plant, and adding important findings to the energy industry.

TI Supply chain analysis for cassava starch production: Cleaner production
   opportunities and benefits
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This research assesses resource efficiency and the loss through the processes of the cassava starch production supply chain in order to find opportunities to improve resource use efficiency, reduce loss and recover resources from waste. The case study was conducted at a cassava starch company in the north of Thailand. The starch supply chain includes cassava cultivation, cassava root transport and processing of cassava starch.
   In the base case, 25,000 tonne of freshwater was used to produce 1000 tonne of cassava starch. Water consumption in the extraction process accounted for over 60% of freshwater use in the supply chain. The extraction and separation processes were the main hotspots because they consumed a large amount of water and a large portion of cassava mass including cassava pulp was separated out at these stages. Over 81% of energy was used in the starch plant including hot air (53%) and electricity (28%). Diesel used for crop production and transport accounted for only 6% and 12% respectively. Drying process was the hotspot in terms of energy use; the process used heat accounting for over 68% of the total energy use in the supply chain. Fortunately, hot air produced from biogas covered 100% of the hot air requirement and electricity produced from biogas covered 86% of the electricity demand in the plant.
   The conventional system of cassava starch production was compared with an improved one incorporating changes in practice of crop production, transport and starch production. In the improved scenario, in crop production, several nutrient management practices were applied along with fertilizer optimization. The starch plant was modified to enhance water recycling and reduce loss in order to reduce cassava root input. Starch loss reduction was achieved in the fiber and pulp separation processes where the largest starch loss occurred. The results showed that the scenario of improved technology and management could reduce consumption of all resources and emissions including cassava roots (4%), fertilizers (50%), water (30%), wastewater (40%) as well as energy (8%). All of the cassava pulp could be recovered to produce ethanol instead of using for feed with some ending up in the landfill in the base case. All wastewater could be reused for irrigation in the cassava farms instead of being evaporated. Moreover, recovering cassava pulp for ethanol production led to positive energy balance and net GHG benefit of 107 t CO(2)eq/y. Net GHG benefit from wastewater reuse for irrigation in the improve scenario was 3 t CO(2)eq. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Resolution of cassava-infecting alphaflexiviruses: Molecular and

AB Several potexviruses (Family Alphaflexiviridae) have been reported infecting cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) in the Americas. They were isolated from severely diseased plants during the last 30-40 years and include: Cassava common mosaic virus (CsCMV), Cassava Caribbean mosaic virus (CsCaMV), Cassava Colombian symptomless virus (CsCSV) and Cassava virus X (CsVX). However, their definitive classification as distinct species remains unresolved for several reasons, including the lack of sequence data and unavailability of samples from original isolates. This complicates disease diagnostics, cassava germplasm exchange certification, evaluation of virus cleaning protocols and epidemiological studies. Furthermore, a recently detected novel alphaflexivirus, indicates that cassava-infecting potexviruses may be more diverse. To solve the identity of these viruses, we started indexing samples from different parts of Colombia using different sets of PCR primers, antisera available and inoculation to indicator plants. Results show that there are three major phylogenetic groups of potexviruses infecting cassava, and they correspond to CsCMV, CsVX and the newly identified Cassava new alphaflexivirus (CsNAV). Bioassays and sequence analysis established that isolates of CsNAV and CsVX cause latent infections in different cassava landraces, they are not efficiently transmitted to the indicator plant Nicotiana benthamiana and they lack the gene 3 of the conserved potexviral 'triple gene block' (TGB). In contrast, all isolates of CsCMV (which have a characteristic potexvirus genome arrangement) caused Cassava Common Mosaic Disease (CCMD) in single infections and were efficiently transmitted to N. benthamiana. Although phylogenetic analysis of the replicase sequence placed CsNAV and CsVX as members of the Potexvirus genus, their distinct genome arrangement and biological characteristics suggest they can be considered as members of a separate taxonomic group.

TI Community phytosanitation to manage cassava brown streak disease
SO VIRUS RESEARCH
CT 13th International Plant Virus Epidemiology Symposium
CY JUN 06-10, 2016
CL Avignon, FRANCE
SP Int Soc Plant Pathol, Int Comm Plant Virus Epidemiol, Natl Inst Agron Res
AB Cassava viruses are the major biotic constraint to cassava production in Africa. Community-wide action to manage them has not been attempted since a successful cassava mosaic disease control programme in the 1930s/40 s in Uganda. A pilot initiative to investigate the effectiveness of community phytosanitation for managing cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) was implemented from 2013 to 2016 in two communities in coastal (Mkuranga) and north-western (Chato) Tanzania. CBSD incidence in local varieties at the outset was > 90%, which was typical of severely affected regions of Tanzania. Following sensitization and monitoring by locally recruited taskforces, there was effective community-wide compliance with the initial requirement to replace local CBSD-infected material with newly-introduced disease-free planting material of improved varieties. The transition was also supported by the free provision of additional seed sources, including maize, sweet potato, beans and cowpeas. Progress of the initiative was followed in randomly-selected monitoring fields in each of the two locations. Community phytosanitation in both target areas produced an area-wide reduction in CBSD incidence, which was sustained over the duration of the programme. In Chato, maximum CBSD incidence was 39.1% in the third season, in comparison with an incidence of > 60% after a single season in a control community where disease-free planting material was introduced in the absence of community phytosanitation. Kriging and geospatial analysis demonstrated that inoculum pressure, which was a function of vector abundance and the number of CBSD-infected plants surrounding monitored fields, was a strong determinant of the pattern of CBSD development in monitored fields. In the first year, farmers achieved yield increases with the new varieties relative to the local variety baseline of 94% in Chato (north-west) and 124% in Mkuranga (coast). Yield benefits of the new material were retained up to the final season in each location. The new variety (Mkombozi) introduced under community phytosanitation conditions in Chato yielded 86% more than the same variety from the same source planted in the no-phytosanitation control location. Although there was an 81% reduction in CBSD incidence in the new variety Kiroba introduced under community phytosanitation compared to control conditions in Mkuranga, there was no concomitant yield increase. Variety Kiroba is known to be tolerant to the effects of CBSD, and tuberous roots of infected plants are frequently asymptomatic. Community phytosanitation has the potential to deliver area-wide and sustained reductions in the incidence of CBSD, which also provide significant productivity gains for growers, particularly where introduced varieties do not have high levels of resistant/tolerance to CBSD. The approach should therefore be considered as a potential component for integrated cassava virus management programmes, particularly where new cassava plantations are being established in areas severely affected by CBSD.

TI Morphological, physicochemical and functional characteristics of starch
   from Marantha ruiziana Koern
SO LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Marantha ruiziana Koern (MrK) is an Amazonian plant with starchy rhizome, which can be used as an alternative botanical source for starch isolation. The morphology, crystallinity, short molecular order, pasting and thermal properties of MrK starch were assessed and compared to cassava starch, a rhizome that is also harvested in the Amazonian region. The amylose content of MrK starch was 29.0%, and the granule size diameter was in range from 9.7 to 24.0 mu m. Starch granules exhibited polyhedral shapes with irregular polygonal surfaces. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed A-type crystallinity with about 26.1% of crystallinity content. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy evidenced reduced molecular order of MrK starch compared to cassava starch, although the gelatinization and pasting temperatures were higher in MrK starch. Also, MrK starch pastes showed high tendency to retrogradation after seven days of storage at 4.0 degrees C as assessed by differential scanning calorimetry. Overall, the results showed that MrK starch has interesting characteristics (e.g., high peak viscosity, thermal stability) that can be exploited for applications in food and non-food products.

TI Starch-Hydrocolloid Interaction in Chemically Leavened Gluten-Free
   Sorghum Bread
SO CEREAL CHEMISTRY
AB A satisfactory chemically leavened gluten-free sorghum bread method was developed by using a blend of 90% commercially milled sorghum flour and 10% rice, tapioca, or potato starch as the "flour." The most effective starch/hydrocolloid combinations in the formula were potato starch with 4% xanthan, tapioca starch with 3% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and rice starch with 3% xanthan. Overall, there was not a significant difference in the quality of loaves made with each starch/hydrocolloid combination. Rapid visco analysis showed that batter viscosity did not have a significant impact on loaf volume index but did affect crumb grain properties. Batters with lower viscosity produced loaves with better crumb grain.

TI Influence of soy fortification on microbial diversity during cassava
   fermentation and subsequent physicochemical characteristics of garri
SO FOOD MICROBIOLOGY
AB This study investigated the influence of the addition of soy products on the microbiology, nutritional and physico-chemical characteristics of garri, a fermented cassava product. Malted soy flour (MSF) and soy protein (SP) were separately added (12% w/w) to cassava mash prior to controlled fermentation, while non-supplemented cassava mash served as a control. Identification of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and aerobic mesophilic bacteria was accomplished by repetitive sequence based (rep)-PCR analysis and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Physicochemical, nutritional and sensory characterisation of control and soy fortified garri was performed using conventional methods. rep-PCR allowed differentiation of 142 isolates into 41 groups corresponding to 6 species of LAB and 25 species of aerobic mesophiles. LAB isolates belonged to the genera Lactobacillus, Weissella, Leuconostoc and Lactococcus with Leuconostoc mesenteroides being the dominant species in control and MSF-cassava while Weissella ciboria dominated SP cassava fermentation. Aerobic mesophiles included Gram positive and negative bacteria including species of the genera Bacillus, Clostridium, Staphylococcus, Serratia, Acinetobacter and Raoultella. Diversity of aerobic mesophiles varied between control, MSF- and SP- cassava mash. Protein content of soy-fortified garri increased from 0.73% to 10.17% and 10.05% in MSF and SP garri respectively with a significant decrease in total cyanide from 26 to 11 ppm. Results from physicochemical and organoleptic evaluation indicate that supplementation of cassava with soy products prior to fermentation can produce acceptable garri. Soy products can be considered a viable option for protein fortification of garri, a low protein food with the aim of combating malnutrition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Evaluation of novel bitter cassava film for equilibrium modified

SO FOOD PACKAGING AND SHELF LIFE
AB Equilibrium modified atmosphere packaging (EMAP) technology offers the possibility to maintain produce postharvest quality and extend its shelf-life. However, EMAP stability depends on well-tuned packaging design parameters to match environment conditions. This study defined design requirements of a biobased film EMAP that can preserve quality and prolong shelf-life of fresh cherry tomatoes under recommended and simulated abuse supply chain conditions. Optimum EMAP was evaluated based on headspace gas composition at 10-20 degrees C, 75-95% RH and verified by determining quality changes of packed cherry tomatoes in using a continuous or micro-perforated (0.27 mu m) bio-based intact bitter cassava (IBC) film. This was compared with a non-bio-based polymer film (oriented polypropylene, OPP). The IBC film attained equilibrium O-2 (2-3%) after 180 h at 10 degrees C, with 0 and 1 perforation, for 75 and 95% RH while OPP film maintained a downward O-2 fall. Continuous and micro-perforated IBC film did not show any major differences in equilibrium headspace O-2, thus perforation can be neglected. Based on desirability optimisation results, biobased IBC film demonstrated better optimized EMAP system in attaining recommended gas and stretching cherry tomato shelf-life as compared to non-biobased (OPP) film. The application of bio-based IBC film offers new possibilities in packaging fresh produce under equilibrium modified atmosphere without compromising their quality.

TI Sand-supported bio-adsorbent column of activated carbon for removal of
   coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli from water
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB New bio-adsorbent carbon materials were synthesized from the leaves and veins of Mucuna pruriens and Manihot esculenta plants, which are locally available in abundance. The synthesized carbons were activated using 0.01N HNO3. Surface area of the activated carbons from M. pruriens and M. esculenta plants was found to be quite high, i.e., 918 and 865 m(2)/g, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the carbons reflects complex disorganized surface structures of different open pore sizes, shapes and dimensions. These properties of the newly synthesized activated carbons led to the development of a sand-supported carbon column, for its possible use in the removal of coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli (E. Coli) from raw water samples. The removal percentage of E. coli was found to be 100% with both the types of carbon adsorbents, as confirmed from the McCardy most probable number table. Similarly, the removal percentage of coliform bacteria was found to be 99 and 98.7% by M. pruriens and M. esculenta carbon columns, respectively. These activated carbons synthesized from locally available plants possess the characteristics of good low-cost adsorbents which can be easily used for the removal of bacteria from water by adsorption method.

TI Heavy gas oil biodesulfurization by Rhodococcus erythropolis ATCC 4277:
   optimized culture medium composition and evaluation of low-cost
   alternative media
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND: The presence of sulfur in oils causes losses in the refining process andoccasions the emission of toxic gases during fuel combustion. Biodesulfurization (BDS) is a bioprocess where some bacteria selectively remove sulfur from heterocyclic compounds. However, there are some limitations to BDS industrial application such as the high costs of the nutritional medium compounds. Previous studies with Rhodococcus erythropolis ATCC 4277 strain showed that the carbon and nitrogen concentration in culture medium significantly affected heavy gas oil (HGO) desulfurization. The aim of this present work was to optimize the nutritional medium in order to reduce the costs associated with medium formulation. The replacement of a synthetic medium by waste (cassava waste) and by products (trub) was also evaluated.
   RESULTS: Rhodococcus erythropolis ATCC 4277 desulfurization capacity was improved by diminishing carbon source concentration from the synthetic nutritional medium. Both trub and cassava waste led to a high desulfurization rate. About 70% of sulfur compounds were removed to the three media tested, achieving a maximum desulfurization rate of 5.0x10(3) mg sulphur kg(-1) HGO h(-1).
   CONCLUSION: The use of an optimized nutritional medium, cassava wastewater and trub can provide an improved methodology for BDS making potential applications in industry feasible. (C) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

TI Impact of treatment with HCL/alcoholic in the modification of corn
   starch
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY
AB The physical, chemical, or enzymatic modified starches are well suited for industrial applications. Acid hydrolysis changes the physicochemical properties without impairing the granular structure of starch. The acid hydrolysis in alcoholic solution can recover the granule starches after modification. Starch, the most abundant carbohydrate in grains, roots and tubers, is composed by amylose and amylopectin. Corn starch represents 85% of the global starch market. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of soft acid, acid-ethanol and acid methanol solutions, considering its application in the paper industry. One sample remained as native. The other six samples were modified with acid, acid-ethanol and acid-methanol solutions, at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.5 mol L-1 (hydrochloric acid). The acid treatment changed the thermal (TG) and rheological (RVA) properties of the corn starch. The TG/DTG results showed shifted (up to 8 A degrees C) stability temperature ranges for the samples treated with a higher concentration of HCl in ethanol and methanol solutions. The RVA results for final viscosity of the treated samples showed an intense reduction of 1405 cP related to the native sample. DSC curves demonstrated that the treatments slightly modified the gelatinization behavior of the starch. The micrographs showed small changes in granules average diameter size after the modification process. Acid hydrolysis did not change the crystalline pattern of corn starch, and its relative crystallinity was slightly affected. According to the results obtained for the acid/alcohol, modified starches present suitable properties for their application in the paper industry.

TI Green microwave-assisted wet digestion method of carbohydrate-rich foods
   with hydrogen peroxide using single reaction chamber and further
   elemental determination using ICP-OES and ICP-MS
SO MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
CT 18th Brazilian Meeting on Analytical Chemistry
CY SEP 18-21, 2016
CL BRAZIL
AB A sample preparation method using only H(2)o(2) in the single reaction chamber system (SRC-UltraWave (TM)) was proposed for carbohydrate-rich foods (CRFs) digestion and further elemental determination by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) based techniques. The greenness of the proposed method was evaluated based on the Analytical Eco-Scale. Additionally, the digestion efficiency, obtained under different conditions (temperature and volume of H2O2), was evaluated based on the concentration of residual carbon (RC). Determination of RC and major elements (Ca, Fe, Mg and Na) were carried out using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), while the minor and toxic elements (As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Mo, Pb, Sr and Zn) were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Digests with lower RC were obtained using 8 mL of 50% H2O2, 250 degrees C and 199 bar. Residual carbon lower than 250 and 400 mg L-1 were obtained for honey and different flours (wheat, corn, cassava and potato), respectively. Maxima sample masses of 0.75 g and 1.25 g were efficiently digested (without insoluble residues) for different flours and honey, respectively. Reference materials (RMs) and certified reference material (CRM) with carbohydrate-rich matrices: corn bran (RM NIST 8433), cotton cellulose (RM IAEA V9) and rice flour (CRM NIST 1568a) were used to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method. Additionally, accuracy was also evaluated by comparison between results obtained using proposed method and those obtained by microwave-assisted wet digestion (MAWD) with concentrated HNO3. Significant differences were not observed when comparing the results of the proposed method with reference values of RMs, CRM and MAWD. Limits of detection obtained by the proposed method were suitable for the quality control analysis of CRFs and ranging from 0.0001 mu g g(-1) to 30 mu g g(-1). As water and oxygen are the main products of H2O2 with CRFs, final digests are suitable for ICP-based techniques analysis due to its low acidity and consequent reduction of physical interferences on nebulization devices. Finally, according to the Analytical Eco-Scale, the proposed method was considered an excellent green analysis with final score of 85. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Polyphenols from Root, Tubercles and Grains Cropped in Brazil: Chemical
   and Nutritional Characterization and Their Effects on Human Health and
   Diseases
SO NUTRIENTS
AB Throughout evolution, plants have developed the ability to produce secondary phenolic metabolites, which are important for their interactions with the environment, reproductive strategies and defense mechanisms. These (poly)phenolic compounds are a heterogeneous group of natural antioxidants found in vegetables, cereals and leguminous that exert beneficial and protective actions on human health, playing roles such as enzymatic reaction inhibitors and cofactors, toxic chemicals scavengers and biochemical reaction substrates, increasing the absorption of essential nutrients and selectively inhibiting deleterious intestinal bacteria. Polyphenols present in some commodity grains, such as soy and cocoa beans, as well as in other vegetables considered security foods for developing countries, including cassava, taro and beetroot, all of them cropped in Brazil, have been identified and quantified in order to point out their bioavailability and the adequate dietary intake to promote health. The effects of the flavonoid and non-flavonoid compounds present in these vegetables, their metabolism and their effects on preventing chronic and degenerative disorders like cancers, diabetes, osteoporosis, cardiovascular and neurological diseases are herein discussed based on recent epidemiological studies.

TI Enhancement of poly(L-lactide)-degrading enzyme production by Laceyella
   sacchari LP175 using agricultural crops as substrates and its
   degradation of poly(L-lactide) polymer
SO POLYMER DEGRADATION AND STABILITY
AB Optimization of the medium for poly(L-lactide) (PLLA)-degrading enzyme production in shake flask experiments was investigated using agricultural products as substrates. Cassava chips and soybean meal were the best carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, as determined by the one-factor-at-a-time method. Enzyme production was significantly enhanced by the addition of phosphates, but was suppressed by the addition of ammonium salt. The maximum enzyme production, 65.5 U/mL, was obtained from the optimized medium consisting of 4.64 g/L cassava chips, 1.53 soybean meal and 031 g/L PLLA powder using central composite design in the basal medium. The optimal physical factors in 3 L airlift fermenter were 50 degrees C, pH 7.0 and 0.5 vvm aeration rate for 18 h, yielded 94.4 U/mL. The crude enzyme was shown to be able to hydrolyze PLLA powder (91%) at 50 degrees C in 72 h which showed high efficiency for recycling of PLLA polymer and reducing the global environmental problem.

TI Investigation of rheological properties and conformation of cassava
   starch in zinc chloride solution
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB Zinc chloride aqueous solution is a non-derivatizing solvent for starch, and can be used as a media for homogeneous starch modification. Here, the rheological properties of starch in ZnCl2 aqueous solution under different conditions are considered. Specifically, a large number (120) of viscosityshear-rate curves for starch-ZnCl2 solutions with different starch contents, ZnCl2 concentrations, and temperatures were obtained and modeled using a master curve method. In particular, the power-law index (n) from the modeling could accurately classify the starch molecules in ZnCl2 aqueous solutions into an insoluble state, a dilute state, a semi-dilute state, and a sticky state, reflecting the different degrees of chain interactions in the solution. In particular, the sticky state would be mostly likely be controlled by the zinc-starch complex, which made the rheological behavior entirely different from that at low ZnCl2 concentrations. The knowledge obtained from this study can be used to guide the homogeneous modification of starch and the fabrication of starch-based materials using green solvents such as aqueous ZnCl2 with desired properties.

TI Rheology, thermal properties, and microstructure of heat-induced gel of
   whey protein-acetylated potato starch
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB The objective of the present work was to investigate the effects of acetylated potato starch (APS) on the rheological and thermal properties and the microstructure of a heat-induced gel of whey protein isolate (WPI) using small-amplitude oscillatory rheometry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The rheological results indicated that the elastic (G') and viscous modulus (G") of the WPI-APS systems increased as the concentrations of APS increased. During heating and cooling, the rheological profiles of the WPI-APS systems exhibited continuous increases in G' at temperatures more closely related to those observed for WPI rather than APS. DSC results indicated that increasing APS concentration had no influence on the individual phase transition of WPI and APS. An analysis of the Flory-Huggins parameter chi(12) suggested an obvious phase separation between WPI and APS in the WPI-APS system. The comprehensive analytical results indicated that the gelatinization for APS was earlier than the denaturation for WPI, contributing to the formation of larger-sized WPI-APS aggregates. The results could provide a theoretical foundation for food preparation containing WPI and APS.

TI Determining significant reaction parameters for cassava starch (Manihot
   esculenta) esterification with long-chain fatty acid chlorides in an
   aqueous solution
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB An important strategy for a highly efficient method to esterify cassava starch with a long-chain hydrophobic acyl group in aqueous solution was reinvestigated. Most of the published reports relied on the elevated reaction temperature in order to disperse and gelatinize starch which negatively affects the esterification. To promote the esterification completion within a short reaction time, lower reaction temperature was employed which is made possible by an efficient method of cassava starch dispersion by NaOH (aq.). The low temperature reaction conditions were explored and found to improve the starch esterification efficiency in aqueous solution. The other reaction parameters including NaOH concentrations, reaction time, and fatty acid chloride chain lengths were also investigated. Low reaction temperature enhances the degree of substitution up to 0.31, and the yield to a range of 50-56%. The results indicate that the conditions for setting up a successful esterification reaction with high reaction efficiency are: i) low reaction temperature (4 degrees C); ii) up to C-12 fatty acid chloride; and iii) low NaOH concentration (1.0-1.5M).

TI Comparative study on the physicochemical properties of pea, chickpea,
   and wheat starch gels in the presence of sweeteners
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB The physicochemical properties of pea, chickpea, and wheat starch mixed with different sweeteners, namely, glucose, sucrose, maltitol, and oligofructose, at different sweetener/starch ratios of 0, 5, 10, and 20% (w/w) were investigated. The gelatinization temperatures (T-o, T-p, and T-c) of the starches increased significantly (p<0.05) with the addition of sweeteners. The effect of sweeteners on raising gelatinization temperatures followed the order: oligofructose> maltitol > sucrose> glucose> control ( water alone). Based on the different combinations, the enthalpy of the three starches increased, remained unchanged, or decreased. Rapid viscosity analyzer (RVA) measurements showed that sucrose, oligofructose, and maltitol were more effective in raising the peak viscosity of starches than glucose. Breakdown and setback were decreased significantly in glucose-starches combinations. Texture profile analysis (TPA) revealed that sweeteners increased the hardness of starch gels to varying degrees as compared to the control. In all cases, the pea and chickpea starch were more sensitive to the addition of sweeteners during paste formation than wheat starch, which might be attributed to the higher amylose content in legume starches. The molecular size and number of hydroxyl groups of the sweeteners should be highly considered in discussing the physicochemical changes of the starches. The results provide new evidence for the effect of sweeteners on starch gelatinization and for the development of sugar-free starch food.

TI Physicochemical properties of Indica rice starch modified by mechanical
   activation and octenyl succinic anhydride
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB Three types of modified Indica rice starch were obtained by combining mechanical activation (MA) with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) esterification. The samples were mechanically activated Indica rice starch (MA-IRS), mechanically activated Indica rice starch esterified by OSA (OSA-MA-IRS) and Indica rice starch that was esterified by OSA and mechanically activated (MA-OSA-IRS). The physicochemical properties of the three types of modified Indica rice starch were studied. The results indicate that the particle shape of OSA-MA-IRS was the most irregular among the three types of modified Indica rice starch, and the changes in morphology of MA-OSA-IRS were similar to those in mechanically activated Indica rice starch (MA-IRS), but the granules of MS-OSA-IRS were smaller than the granules of MA-IRS after an identical mechanical activation time. The results of X-ray diffraction showed that a new crystalline structure formed during preparation of OSA-MA-IRS, and the crystal structure of OSA-IRS was more easily destroyed by mechanical force than that of IRS. Therefore, for the same mechanical activation time, the transparency and reducing power for each sample were ranked in the following order: MA-OSA-IRS, MA-IRS, and OSA-MA-IRS. However, the blue value from iodine staining and apparent viscosity showed the reverse trend. The emulsifying activity index decreased in the following order: OSA-MA-IRS, MA-OSA-IRS, and MA-IRS.

TI Microwave processing techniques and their recent applications in the
   food industry
SO TRENDS IN FOOD SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Background: Microwave processing techniques have been extensively used in the food industry due to its significant reduction in cooking time and energy consumption. Microwave processing technologies such as microwave drying, heating and sterilizing play a significant role in food quality and safety control. However, few reviews have been published in recent years summarizing the latest developments in the application of microwave technology in the food industry.
   Scope and approach: This review focuses on recent applications of microwave processing technologies including microwave drying, heating, and sterilizing in fruit (banana, apple, olive, sour cherries, pomegranate arils, blueberries, kiwifruit, aronia, strawberry, and grape tomato), vegetables (potato, bamboo shoot, purslane leaves, onion, green bean, pumpkin, eggplant, edamame, sea tangle, garlic, kale, red cabbage, tomato, cassava, lentils, chickpea, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, jalapefio peppers, and coriander foliage), and meat products (sardine fish, restructured silver carp slices, sea cucumber, beef semitendinosus muscle, bovine supraspinatus muscle, camel longissimus dorsi muscle, foal meat, bovine gluteus medium muscle, chicken steak, mature cows semimembranosus and semitendinosus muscles, kavurma (a ready-to-eat meat product), salmon, cod, drumettes, and beef slices), changes in product quality as affected with microwave processing are discussed in details, and future directions of research are presented.
   Key findings and conclusions: Microwave drying has the advantages of low energy consumption and high efficiency as compared to conventional drying, while producing more porous structure of foods. Microwave drying usually combines with other conventional drying to enhance the quality of a food product. Compared with the traditional method, microwave heating or cooking can generally retain higher levels of bioactive components, antioxidant activity and attractive color of vegetables, while microwave cooking with water can cause a serious drop in nutrients due to leaching and thermal liability. Microwave sterilization has the capacity to completely inactivate microorganisms and effectively destroy enzyme activity, and less effect on antioxidant activity, texture and color of food products compared with conventional pasteurization.

TI Enhanced Biodegradation of Sugar Cane Bagasse by Coculture of
   Clostridium thermocellum and Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense
   Supplemented with CaCO3
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB Pretreated sugar cane bagasse (SCB) could be directly degraded by a designed coculture system with Clostridium thermocellum and Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense for biological hydrogen and ethanol production, and the production was remarkably improved by CaCO3 supplementation. Here, the effects of CaCO3 concentration (10-100 mM) on the production of hydrogen and ethanol were investigated. Under the optimal CaCO3 concentration of 40 mM, hydrogen production reached 87.56 +/- 4.08 mmol/L from 2% pretreated SCB with a yield of 4.38 mmol H-2/g SCB, an 88.62% increase over the culture without added CaCO3 (46.42 +/- 1.22 mmol/L and 2.32 mmol H-2/g SCB). Additionally, the maximum ethanol concentration reached 10.60 +/- 0.81 mM, a 192.82% increase over the control (3.62 +/- 0.14 mM). The stimulatory effect of CaCO3 on the biodegradation of SCB was primarily ascribed to the buffering capacity of CO32-.This study developed a novel strategy to improve SCB biodegradation for biofuel production.

TI A novel biochar from Manihot esculenta Crantz waste: application for the
   removal of Malachite Green from wastewater and optimization of the
   adsorption process
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The adsorptive removal of Malachite Green (MG) by a novel biochar namely Cassava Rind Carbon (CRC) was studied in a batch system. Moreover, Box-Behnken Response Surface Methodology was used to optimize operating conditions of the adsorption process. Characterization was done by Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy (ATR/FTIR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and pH zero charge point (pH(ZCP)). The pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir model provided the best fit for kinetic and isotherm, respectively. The maximum capacity of dye adsorbed was 932.98 mg/g at 25 degrees C. The influence of temperature, the mass of adsorbent and the concentration of dye was studied. The optimal amount of adsorbed MG was 1,363.58 mg/g corresponding to 50 degrees C, 5 mg of CRC and 150 mg/L of dye. According to the high performance exhibited by CRC in this study, Manihot esculenta Crantz waste can be used as a better and low-cost biomass for wastewater decolourization.

TI AGRONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF CASSAVA GENOTYPES FROM THE IN VITRO SHOOT TIP
   CULTURE SUBMITTED TO CLONAL CLEANING
SO BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
AB This study aimed to evaluate the agronomic performance of cassava genotypes from the in vitro shoot tip culture to eliminate the cassava frogskin disease for several root and aerial part characteristics. Cassava plants from accessions BGM0315, BGM0464 and BGM0841 infected with cassava frogskin disease were grown in a greenhouse after clonal cleaning. Cuttings from the three accessions were subjected to tetracycline concentrations (0, 5, 10 and 15 mg L-1) for three minutes, and then maintained in an acclimatized chamber (35 +/- 1 degrees C and 16 hour photoperiod). Shoots were disinfected for excising shoot tips (0.2 mm and 0.4 mm) and inoculated in a culture medium containing the same concentrations of tetracycline used in the cuttings. After 60 days of cultivation, the explants were transferred to medium without antibiotic, 30 days later they were acclimatized for a period of 70 days for subsequent planting in the field. Seven months after planting, agronomical evaluation was held for root and aerial part characteristics. No influence of isolated shoot tip size was noticed on agronomic characteristics, while the addition of tetracycline in the culture medium, specifically at the concentrations of 5 mg L-1 and 15 mg L-1, was favorable to the development of the root system of plants in the field. The results revealed that the agronomic performance of cassava plants derived from in vitro cultivation are higher for the production of basic propagation material for the following production cycles, as well as root production for commercial use with subsequent generation of income.

TI Inbreeding depression for severity caused by leaf diseases in cassava
SO EUPHYTICA
AB The use of inbred populations in cassava has been little exploited by breeding programs. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of inbreeding depression (ID) in S-1 families for resistance to leaf diseases and to select transgressive individuals. Five cassava varieties (Cascuda, BRS Formosa, Fecula Branca, Mani-Branca and BRS Mulatinha) were selfed, and the families S-0 and S-1 were evaluated for severity caused by cassava white leaf spot (CWLS), cassava brown leaf spot (CBRLS) and cassava blight leaf spot (CBLS) under field conditions. Differences among S-1 families and between generations (S-0 x S-1) were identified for all diseases. The wide variation of CWLS (2.16-93.38%), CBRLS (15.31-69.39%) and CBLS (15.70-53.64%) severity highlighted the occurrence of ID in S-1 families, in which the average was 12.61% (CWLS), 13.72% (CBRLS) and 15.92% (CBLS). Mean estimates of homozygous loci contribution (mu + alpha) were of higher magnitude compared with heterozygous loci contribution (d) for all diseases and families. Even in the occurrence of ID, it was possible to select resistant S-1 individuals, in a way that the reduction in the severity of diseases based on the selection of the five most resistant individuals was 75.80% (S-1-BRS Formosa) for CWLS, 38.64% (S-1-Cascuda) for CBRLS and 33.51% (S-1-Cascuda) for CBLS. These results demonstrate the predominance of additive genetic effects and the possibility to select transgressive individuals in S-1 families for increasing the resistance to cassava leaf diseases.

It was stable at a pH range of 6.0-7.0, but was markedly sensitive to high temperatures and low pH conditions, even at a pH value of 5. Ba2+, Al3+, and Co2+ activated enzyme activity. This bacterium was capable of producing 99.2% high optically pure L-lactic acid of 4.3 and 8.2 g/L under uncontrolled and controlled pH at 6.5 conditions, respectively, in the MRS broth containing 10 g/L cassava starch as the sole carbon source when cultivated at 37 A degrees C for 48 h. A control pH condition of 6.5 improved and stabilized the yield of L-lactic acid production directly from starch even at a high concentration of starch at up to 150 g/L. This paper is the first report describing the properties of purified alpha-amylase from E. faecium. Additionally, pullulanase and cyclodextrinase activities were also firstly recorded from E. faecium K-1.

TI Cassava yield loss in farmer fields was mainly caused by low soil
   fertility and suboptimal management practices in two provinces of the
   Democratic Republic of Congo
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB A better understanding of the factors that contribute to low cassava yields in farmers' fields is required to guide the formulation of cassava intensification programs. Using a boundary line approach, we analysed the contribution of soil fertility, pest and disease infestation and farmers' cultivation practices to the cassava yield gap in Kongo Central (KC) and Tshopo (TSH) provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Data were obtained by monitoring 42 and 37 fanner-managed cassava fields during two cropping cycles in KC and one cropping cycle in TSH, respectively. Each field was visited three times over the cassava growing period for the observations. Logistic model was fitted against the observed maximum cassava root yields and used to calculate the achievable yield per field and for individual factor. At field level, the factor that led to the lowest achievable yield (Y-up(01) was considered as the dominant yield constraint. Cassava yield loss per field was expressed as the increase in the maximal root yield observed per province (Y-att-attainable yield) compared to Y-up(i). Y-att was 21 and 24 tha(-1) in TSH and KC, respectively. With the cassava varieties that farmers are growing in the study areas, pests and diseases played a sparse role in the yield losses. Cassava mosaic was the only visible disease we observed and it was the dominant yield constraint in 3% and 12% of the fields in KC and TSH, respectively. The frequent yield constraints were suboptimal field management and low soil fertility. Cultivation practices and soil parameters led to Y-up(1)1 in 47% and 50% of the fields in KC, and in 47% and 41% of those in TSH, respectively. Individual soil parameters were the yield constraint in few fields, suggesting that large-scale programs in terms of lime application or recommendation of the blanket fertilisers would result in sparse efficacy. In KC, yield losses caused by low soil fertility averaged 6.2 t ha(-1) and were higher than those caused by suboptimal field management (5.5 t ha(-1)); almost nil for cassava mosaic disease (CMD). In TSH, yield losses caused by low soil fertility (4.5 t ha(-1)) were lower than those caused by suboptimal field management (6.5 t ha(-1)) and CMD (6.1 t ha(-1)). Irrespective of the constraint type, yield loss per field was up to 48% and 64% of the Y-att in KC and TSH, respectively. Scenario analysis indicated that the yield losses would remain at about two third of these levels while the dominant constraint was only overcome. We concluded that integrated and site-specific management practices are needed to close the cassava yield gap and maximize the efficacy of cassava intensification programs.

TI Institutional challenges to climate change adaptation: A case study on
   policy action gaps in Uganda
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB Despite the considerable progress made in the last decade towards building governance systems for climate change adaptation in Africa, implementation still limits positive responses. This study applies an iterative process of field assessments and literature reviews across multiple governance levels and spatial scales to identify constraints to effective formulation and implementation of climate change related policies and strategies in Uganda. Data was collected through sex-segregated participatory vulnerability assessments with farming communities in Rakai district, policy document reviews, and interviews with policy actors at national and district levels. Findings reveal that the key challenges to effective policy implementation are diverse and cut across the policy development and implementation cycle. Policies are mainly developed by central government agencies; other actors are insufficiently involved while local communities are excluded. There is also a communication disconnect between national, district, and community levels. Coupled with limited technical capacity and finances, political interference, and absence of functional implementation structures across these levels, climate change adaptation becomes constrained. We propose strategies that enhance linkages between levels and actors, which will improve policy formulation, implementation and ultimately adaptation by smallholders.

TI A purely green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Carica papaya,
   Manihot esculenta, and Morinda citrifolia: synthesis and antibacterial
   evaluations
SO BIOPROCESS AND BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB Green procedure for synthesizing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is currently considered due to its economy and toxic-free effects. Several existing works on synthesizing AgNPs using leaves extract still involve the use of physical or mechanical treatment such as heating or stirring, which consume a lot of energy. To extend and explore the green extraction philosophy, we report here the synthesis and antibacterial evaluations of a purely green procedure to synthesize AgNPs using Carica papaya, Manihot esculenta, and Morinda citrifolia leaves extract without the aforementioned additional treatment. The produced AgNPs were characterized using the ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and antibacterial investigations. For antibacterial tests, two bacteria namely Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus were selected. The presently employed method has successfully produced spherical AgNPs having sizes ranging from 9 to 69 nm, with plasmonic characteristics ranging from 356 to 485 nm, and energy-dispersive X-ray peak at approximately 3 keV. In addition, the smallest particles can be produced when Manihot esculenta leaves extract was applied. Moreover, this study also confirmed that both the leaves and synthesized AgNPs exhibit the antibacterial capability, depending on their concentration and the bacteria type.

TI Films Made by Blending Poly(epsilon-Caprolactone) with Starch and Flour
   from Sagu Rhizome Grown at the Venezuelan Amazons
SO JOURNAL OF POLYMERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB Starch-based composite films have been proposed as food packaging. In this context, the study of non-conventional starch sources (sagu, Canna edulis Kerr) has worldwide special attention, because these materials can impart different properties as carbohydrate polymers. A thorough study of the matrices used (sagu starch and flour) was carried out. In the same way, thermoplastic starch (TPS)/PCL blend and thermoplastic flour (TFS)/PCL blend were obtained by melt mixing followed by compression moulding containing glycerol as plasticizer. In this study, chemical composition of the matrices and their properties were related with the properties of the developed films. Moisture content, water solubility, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis and mechanical and microstructural properties were evaluated in the films. Taking into account the results, the sagu flour has great potential as starchy source for food packaging applications. However, concretely the flour had lower compatibility with the PCL compared to the starch/PCL blend.

TI Cognitive and motor performance in Congolese children with konzo during
   4 years of follow-up: a longitudinal analysis
SO LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
AB Background Konzo is an irreversible upper-motor neuron disorder affecting children dependent on bitter cassava for food. The neurocognitive ability of children with konzo over time has yet to be fully documented.
   Methods We did a longitudinal study in a konzo outbreak zone continuously affected by konzo since 1990, in the district of Kahemba, southern Bandundu Province, Congo. We enrolled children with a record of neurological diagnosis of konzo in Kahemba town. For all study children with konzo enrolled in the final sample for the baseline assessment, a neurological exam was done by neurologists to confirm konzo diagnosis using the 1996 WHO criteria at 2 years and 4 years. In the initial baseline sample for each child with konzo, we attempted to get consent from a comparison child without konzo (1996 WHO criteria) within 2 years of age, from a neighbouring household who met inclusion criteria. The neuropsychological assessments were the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, second edition (KABC-II), and the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, second edition (BOT-2).
   Findings Data collection occurred between Oct 12, 2011, and Aug 14, 2015, in the town of Kahemba. 123 children from the Congo with konzo and 87 presumably healthy children without konzo from neighbouring households were enrolled. The planned assessments were completed by 76 children with konzo and 82 children without konzo at 2-year follow-up, and by 55 children with konzo and 33 children without konzo at 4-year follow-up. Boys with konzo did worse than those without konzo on the KABC-II Learning (p = 0.0424) and on the Mental Processing Index (MPI; p = 0.0111) assessments at 2-year follow-up, but girls did not. These differences observed in boys might have been caused by stunting. At 4-year follow-up, the difference in KABC-II MPI score between boys or girls with or without konzo was not significant. Both boys and girls with konzo had lower scores on BOT-2 than children without konzo at both follow-up times (p < 0.0001). These differences were not attenuated when controlling for physical growth. Boys with and without konzo declined on BOT-2 fine motor proficiency at 2-year follow-up (boys with konzo p = 0.0076; boys without konzo p = 0.0224) and KABC-II MPI performance at 2-year follow-up and 4-year follow-up (2 years: boys with konzo p < 0.0001, boys without konzo p = 0.0213; 4 years: boys with konzo p = 0.0256, boys without konzo p = 0.10), but that was not the case for the girls with scores remaining stable regardless of konzo status. For boys, increases in urinary thiocyanate concentration was significantly associated with reductions in BOT-2 motor proficiency (p = 0.0321), but was not significantly associated in girls and urinary thiocyanate concentration was not associated with KABC-II MPI score for either boys or girls.
   Interpretation Motor and cognitive performance continues to be significantly impaired in boys with konzo at 2-year follow-up compared with boys without konzo. Because these impairments are associated in part with exposure to poorly processed cassava as measured by urinary thiocyanate, interventions are urgently needed to ensure improved processing of cassava to detoxify this food source.

TI Could biofuel development stress China's water resources?
SO GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
AB Concerns over energy shortages and global climate change have stimulated developments toward renewable energy. Biofuels have been developed to replace fossil fuels to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and other environmental impacts. However, food security and water scarcity are other growing concerns, and the increased production of biofuels may increase these problems. This study focuses on whether biofuel development would stress China's water resources. Cassava-based fuel ethanol and sweet sorghum-based fuel ethanol are the focus of this study because they are the most typical nongrain biofuels in China. The spatial distribution of the total water requirement of fuel ethanol over its life cycle process was simulated using a biophysical biogeochemical model and marginal land as one of the types of input data for the model to avoid impacts on food security. The total water requirement of fuel ethanol was then compared with the spatial distribution of water resources, and the influence of the development of fuel ethanol on water resources at the pixel and river basin region scales was analyzed. The result showed that the total water requirement of fuel ethanol ranges from 37.81 to 862.29 mm. However, considering water resource restrictions, not all of the marginal land is suitable for the development of fuel ethanol. Approximately 0.664 million km(2) of marginal land is suitable for the development of fuel ethanol, most of which is located in the south of China, where water resources are plentiful. For these areas, the value of fuel ethanol's water footprint ranges from 0.05 to 11.90 m(3) MJ(-1). From the water point of view, Liaoning province, Guizhou province, Anhui province and Hunan province can be given priority for the development of fuel ethanol.

TI Effects of stirring on cassava effluent treatment in an anaerobic
   horizontal tubular pilot reactor with support medium - A Review
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The cassava starch industries generate wastewater which; when stabilized in ponds, wastes biogas and pollutes atmosphere. Aiming to change this reality, the research was developed in a onephase anaerobic horizontal pilot reactor, at a cassava starch industry in Toledo, PR, Brazil. The stirring was done by biogds recirculation and the support medium was built with bamboo. The experimental design was completely randomized, with answers submitted to multivariate analysis. The average organic load rates (OLR) in chemical oxygen demand (COD) were 0.556, 0.670, 0.678, 0.770 and 0.902 g L-1, and average reductions for COD (CODR) were 88, 80, 88, 67 and 70. Although the volatile acidity/total alkalinity ratio (VA/TA) presented risk values, the reactor remained stable, thanks to the support medium presence.

TI Phylogeny and expression pattern analysis of TCP transcription factors
   in cassava seedlings exposed to cold and/or drought stress
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The TCP transcription factors usually act as integrators of multiple growth regulatory and environmental stimuli. However, little is known about this gene family in the important tropical crop cassava (Manihot esculenta). In this study, 36 TCP genes were identified and renamed based on cassava whole-genome sequence and their sequence similarity with Arabidopsis TCPs. Typical TCP domains were detected in these proteins by multiple sequence alignment analysis. Evolutionary analysis indicated that MeTCPs could be divided into 8 subgroups, which was further supported by gene structure and conserved motif analyses. qRT-PCR analysis revealed tissue-specific and hormone-responsive expression patterns of MeTCP genes. Moreover, with global expression and promoter analysis, we found that MeTCPs showed similar or distinct expression patterns under cold and/or drought stress, suggesting that they might participate in distinct signaling pathways. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of TCP gene family in the cassava genome. The data will be useful for uncovering the potential functions of MeTCP genes, and their possible roles in mediating hormone and abiotic stress responses in cassava.

TI Synthesis and swelling property of superabsorbent starch grafted with
   acrylic acid/2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid
SO JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
AB BACKGROUND: In order to develop starch-based superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) with high water absorbency, both acrylic acid (AA) and 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS) were graft copolymerized onto cassava starch, and St-g-AA-AMPS SAP was successfully synthesized. The effect of AA/AMPS molar ratio on the structure and swelling property of SAP was investigated.
   RESULTS: Introduction of AMPS units improved the storage modulus and crosslinking density of St-g-AA-AMPS SAP, and was beneficial in forming a perfect network structure. With increasing AMPS content, the equilibrium swelling ratio and swelling rate constant (k) of the SAP first increased and then decreased, and the maximum swelling ratio reached 1200.0 and 90.0 g/g in distilledwater and brine respectively, resulting from the high ionization constant and hydrophilic ability ofAMPS, and improved tolerance to brine. By introducing AMPS units, the re-swelling capability of SAP was improved, and more hydrogen bonds could form between molecules of water and SAP, leading to an increase in non-freezing bound water and freezing bound water, and the water retention of SAP was enhanced.
   CONCLUSION: Introduction of AMPS units improved the water absorption capacity, swelling rate, and water retention ability of St-g-AA-AMPS SAP, presenting wide application potential in agriculture and horticulture of desert regions. (C) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

TI Alpha-Glucan, Water Dikinase 1 Affects Starch Metabolism and Storage
   Root Growth in Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz)
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Regulation of storage root development by source strength remains largely unknown. The cassava storage root delay (srd) T-DNA mutant postpones storage root development but manifests normal foliage growth as wild-type plants. The SRD gene was identified as an orthologue of a-glucan, water dikinase 1 (GWD1), whose expression is regulated under conditions of light/dark cycles in leaves and is associated with storage root development. The GWD1-RNAi cassava plants showed both retarded plant and storage root growth, as a result of starch excess phenotypes with reduced photosynthetic capacity and decreased levels of soluble saccharides in their leaves. These leaves contained starch granules having greatly increased amylose content and type C semi-crystalline structures with increased short chains that suggested storage starch. In storage roots of GWD1-RNAi lines, maltose content was dramatically decreased and starches with much lower phosphorylation levels showed a drastically reduced beta-amylolytic rate. These results suggested that GWD1 regulates transient starch morphogenesis and storage root growth by decreasing photo-assimilation partitioning from the source to the sink and by starch mobilization in root crops.

TI A time series transcriptome analysis of cassava (Manihot esculenta
   Crantz) varieties challenged with Ugandan cassava brown streak virus
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A time-course transcriptome analysis of two cassava varieties that are either resistant or susceptible to cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) was conducted using RNASeq, after graft inoculation with Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV). From approximately 1.92 billion short reads, the largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was obtained in the resistant (Namikonga) variety at 2 days after grafting (dag) (3887 DEGs) and 5 dag (4911 DEGs). At the same time points, several defense response genes (encoding LRR-containing, NBARC-containing, pathogenesis-related, late embryogenesis abundant, selected transcription factors, chaperones, and heat shock proteins) were highly expressed in Namikonga. Also, defense-related GO terms of 'translational elongation', 'translation factor activity', 'ribosomal subunit' and 'phosphorelay signal transduction', were overrepresented in Namikonga at these time points. More reads corresponding to UCBSV sequences were recovered from the susceptible variety (Albert) (733 and 1660 read counts per million (cpm)) at 45 dag and 54 dag compared to Namikonga (10 and 117 cpm respectively). These findings suggest that Namikonga's resistance involves restriction of multiplication of UCBSV within the host. These findings can be used with other sources of evidence to identify candidate genes and biomarkers that would contribute substantially to knowledge-based resistance breeding.

TI Simultaneous saccharification and viscosity reduction of cassava pulp
   using a multi-component starch- and cell-wall degrading enzyme for
   bioethanol production
SO 3 BIOTECH
AB In this study, an efficient ethanol production process using simultaneous saccharification and viscosity reduction of raw cassava pulp with no prior high temperature pre-gelatinization/liquefaction step was developed using a crude starch- and cell wall-degrading enzyme preparation from Aspergillus aculeatus BCC17849. Proteomic analysis revealed that the enzyme comprised a complex mixture of endo- and exo-acting amylases, cellulases, xylanases, and pectina ses belonging to various glycosyl hydrolase families. Enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency was dependent on the initial solid loading in the reaction. Reduction in mixture viscosity was observed with a rapid decrease in complex viscosity from 3785 to 0.45 Pa s with the enzyme dosage of 2.19 mg/g on a dried weight basis within the first 2 h, which resulted from partial destruction of the plant cell wall fiber and degradation of the released starch granules by the enzymes as shown by scanning electron microscopy. Saccharification of cassava pulp at an initial solid of 16% (w/v) in a bench-scale bioreactor resulted in 736.4 mg glucose/g, which is equivalent to 82.92% glucose yield based on the total starch and glucan in the substrate, after 96 h at 40 A degrees C. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of cassava pulp by Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the uncooked enzymatic process led to a final ethanol concentration of 6.98% w/v, equivalent to 96.7% theoretical yield based on the total starch and cellulose content. The results demonstrated potential of the enzyme for low-energy processing of cassava pulp in biofuel industry.

TI Comparative study of the use of natural and artificial coagulants for
   the treatment of sullage (domestic wastewater)
SO COGENT ENGINEERING
AB This work presented a comparative study of the effectiveness of natural coagulant (Moringa oleifera and hydrolyzed cassava) extracts and artificial coagulant (alum) as primary coagulants for sullage from homes and cafeteria at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Stock solutions of these coagulants were prepared, and jar test of their varying mixing ratios used to obtain optimum dosages of 200, 30 and 1,000mg/l for Moringa, alum and cassava respectively. The effects of these optimum dosages were tested against turbidity, pH, BOD, nutrients, hardness and coli form. All tested parameters were significantly sensitive to concentrations of used stock solutions. 100% Moringa seed extract resulted in all the treated parameters (except turbidity) being within tolerable limits. The stock solution of 100% Alum also showed all tested parameters (except pH) to be within the standards for drinking water. The combination of Moringa and alum stock solutions at 50% each (A50M50) showed the overall best result with the resultant water fit for drinking. The result of the comparative test showed that alum with its residual and health implications can be successfully replaced, partially or wholly, with natural coagulants.

TI Fermentation Process and Metabolic Flux of Ethanol Production from the
   Detoxified Hydrolyzate of Cassava Residue
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB With the growth of the world population, energy problems are becoming increasingly severe; therefore, sustainable energy sources have gained enormous importance. With respect to ethanol fuel production, biomass is gradually replacing grain as the main raw material. In this study, we explored the fermentation of five- and six-carbon sugars, the main biomass degradation products, into alcohol. We conducted mutagenic screening specifically for Candida tropicalis CICC1779 to obtain a strain that effectively used xylose (Candida tropicalis CICC1779-Dyd). By subsequently studying fermentation conditions under different initial liquid volume oxygen transfer coefficients (k(L)alpha), and coupling control of the aeration rate and agitation speed under optimal conditions, the optimal dissolved oxygen change curve was obtained. In addition, we constructed metabolic flow charts and equations to obtain a better understanding of the fermentation mechanism and to improve the ethanol yield. In our experiment, the ethanol production of the wild type stain was 17.58 g center dot L-1 at a k(L alpha) of 120. The highest ethanol yield of the mutagenic strains was 24.85 g center dot L-1. The ethanol yield increased to 26.56 g center dot L-1 when the dissolved oxygen content was optimized, and the conversion of sugar into alcohol reached 0.447 g center dot g(-1) glucose (the theoretical titer of yeast-metabolized xylose was 0.46 g ethanol/g xylose and the glucose ethanol fermentation titer was 0.51 g ethanol/g glucose). Finally, the detected activity of xylose reductase and xylose dehydrogenase was higher in the mutant strain than in the original, which indicated that the mutant strain (CICC1779-Dyd) could effectively utilize xylose for metabolism.

TI One-step synthesis of corn starch urea based acrylate superabsorbents
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB A one-step synthesis procedure for starch-based acrylate superabsorbent polymers was proposed. The reaction conditions that may affect the water absorption capacity were discussed. A transparent gel-like polymer containing urea (USAP) was successfully obtained by dissolving starch in a NaOH solution without further gelatinizing processing and using AA directly without prior neutralization. Urea was used as the nitrogen source and pore-forming agent to improve the performance of the USAP. The optimum reaction conditions of the swelling ratio were also studied. A corn starch USAP was synthesized under the optimum conditions, and the water absorbency was 2704 +/- 22, 561 +/- 39, 10065, and 96 +/- 4 g/g, respectively, in distilled water, running water, physiological saline, and artificial urine. Five kinds of starch-based USAPs were also successfully prepared under the same conditions with excellent water absorption capacities, revealing that the one-step method was a more convenient method for a potential industrial application pathway. The polymers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. The results indicated that the PAA chains were successfully grafted onto the St backbone. However, the St molecular structure was not completely destroyed during the graft polymerization. The thermal analysis and nitrogen content results proved that urea was also involved in the graft copolymerization. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Morphological diversity of cassava accessions of the south-central
   mesoregion of the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil
SO GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH
AB Genetic variability of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) in Brazil is wide, being this the result of natural and cultural selection during pre-and post-domestication of the species in different environments. Given the number of species of the genus found in the region (38 of a total of 98 species), the central region of Brazil was defined as the primary center of cassava diversity. Therefore, genetic diversity characterization of cassava accessions is fundamental, both for farmers and for plant breeders, because it allows the organization of genetic resources and better utilization of available genetic diversity. This research aims to assess genetic divergence of cassava accessions from the south-central region of the State of Mato Grosso, based on multi-categorical morphological traits. For this purpose, 38 qualitative and quantitative morphological descriptors were used. Genetic diversity was expressed by the genetic similarity index, with subsequent clustering of accessions by the modified Tocher's procedure and UPGMA. Of 38 descriptors, only growth habit of stem showed no variability. Tocher and UPGMA methods were efficient and corroborated on group composition. Both methods were able to group accessions of different localities in distinct group consistency.

TI Phytoplasma infection of a tropical root crop triggers bottom-up
   cascades by favoring generalist over specialist herbivores
SO PLOS ONE
AB Global interest on plant-microbe-insect interactions is rapidly growing, revealing the multiple ways in which microorganisms mediate plant-herbivore interactions. Phytopathogens regularly alter whole repertoires of plant phenotypic traits, and bring about shifts in key chemical or morphological characteristics of plant hosts. Pathogens can also cause cascading effects on higher trophic levels, and eventually shape entire plant-associated arthropod communities. We tested the hypothesis that a Candidatus Phytoplasma causing cassava witches' broom (CWB) on cassava (Manihot esculenta Grantz) is altering species composition of invasive herbivores and their associated parasitic hymenopterans. We conducted observational studies in cassava fields in eastern Cambodia to assess the effect of CWB infection on abundance of specialist and generalist mealybugs (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae), and associated primary and hyper-parasitoid species. CWB infection positively affects overall mealybug abundance and species richness at a plant-and field-level, and disproportionately favors a generalist mealybug over a specialist feeder. CWB phytoplasma infection led to increased parasitoid richness and diversity, with richness of 'comparative' specialist taxa being the most significantly affected. Parasitism rate did not differ among infected and uninfected plants, and mealybug host suppression was not impacted. CWB phytoplasma modifies host plant quality for sap-feeding homopterans, differentially affects success rates of two invasive species, and generates niche opportunities for higher trophic orders. By doing so, a Candidatus phytoplasma affects broader food web structure and functioning, and assumes the role of an ecosystem engineer. Our work unveils key facets of phytoplasma ecology, and sheds light upon complex multi-trophic interactions mediated by an emerging phytopathogen. These findings have further implications for invasion ecology and management.

TI Digestibility, physicochemical and structural properties of octenyl
   succinic anhydride-modified cassava starches with different degree of
   substitution
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB The octenylsuccinylated cassava starch (OSCS) samples with a degree of substitution (DS) in the range of 0.008 to 0.035 were prepared in this study. The structural, physicochemical, and in vitro digestibility properties of OS-starch samples were investigated. Intensities of characteristic peaks at 1724 cm(-1) and 1572 cm(-1) increased with increasing DS, which confirmed successful introduction of ester carbonyl groups into starch molecules. The esterification occurred primarily in the amorphous regions and surface of starch granule, and the crystalline pattern did not change. SEM results revealed that the modification had slight effects on the morphological structure of native starch. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of OS-starch samples showed lower onset temperature, peak temperature, conclusion temperature, and endothermic energy than their native counterpart. This study also showed that esterification with OSA was an effective method for increasing slowly digestible starch and resistant starch contents in starch samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Genetic diversity of Bemisia tabaci species colonizing cassava in
   Central African Republic characterized by analysis of cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit I
SO PLOS ONE
AB After 2007, upsurges of whiteflies on cassava plants and high incidences of cassava diseases were observed in Central African Republic. This recent upsurge in the abundance of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) was directly linked to serious damage to cassava crops resulting from spread of whitefly-borne cassava mosaic geminiviruses (CMGs). There is currently very little information describing whitefly populations on cassava and associated crops in Central African Republic. The current study aimed to address this gap, and to determine whether the increasing damage associated with B. tabaci whiteflies was the consequence of a new invasion, or an upsurge of a local population. The molecular genetic identification and phylogenetic relationships of 898 B. tabaci adult individuals collected from representative locations (54) throughout CAR were determined based on their mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I sequences (mtCOI). Field and ecological data were also collected from each site, including whitefly abundance, CMD incidence, host plants colonized by B. tabaci and agro-ecological zone. Phylogenetic analysis of the whitefly mtCOI sequences indicated that SSA1 (-SG1, -SG2), SSA3, MED, MEAM1 and Indian Ocean (IO) putative species occur in CAR. One specific haplotype of SSA1-SG1 (SSA1-SG1-P18F5) predominated on most cassava plants and at the majority of sites. This haplotype was identical to the SSA1-SG1 Mukono8-4 (KM377961) haplotype that was recorded from Uganda but that also occurs widely in CMD pandemic-affected areas of East Africa. These results suggest that the SSA1-SG1-P18F5 haplotype occurring in CAR represents a recent invasive population, and that it is the likely cause of the increased spread and severity of CMD in CAR. Furthermore, the high mtDNA sequence diversity observed for SSA1 and its broad presence on all sites and host plants sampled suggest that this genetic group was the dominant resident species even before the arrival of this new invasive haplotype.

TI Continuous-flow electro-assisted acid hydrolysis of granular potato
   starch via inductive methodology
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB The induced electric field assisted hydrochloric acid (IEF-HCl) hydrolysis of potato starch was investigated in a fluidic system. The impact of various reaction parameters on the hydrolysis rate, including reactor number (1-4), salt type (KCl, MgCl2, FeCl3), salt concentration (3-12%), temperature (40-55 degrees C), and hydrolysis time (0-60 h), were comprehensively assessed. Under optimal conditions, the maximum reducing sugar content in the hydrolysates was 10.59 g/L. X-ray diffraction suggested that the crystallinity of IEF-HCI-modified starches increased with the intensification of hydrolysis but was lower than that of native starch. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that the surface and interior regions of starch granules were disrupted by the hydrolysis. The solubility of IEF-HCI-modified starches increased compared to native starch while their swelling power decreased, contributing to a decline in paste viscosity. These results suggest that IEF is a notable potential electrotechnology to conventional hydrolysis under mild conditions without any electrode touching the subject. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Effect of salt on the glass transition of condensed tapioca starch
   systems
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB This work examines the effect of including hydrated NaCl and CaCl2 (up to 6% w/w) on the physicochemical properties of condensed tapioca starch. Samples were prepared by hot pressing at 120 degrees C to produce condensed systems that covered a range of moisture contents from 7.34% wow (23% relative humidity) to 19.52% wow (75% relative humidity). Tensile storage modulus and heat flow measurements were taken using DMA and MDSC, which were accompanied by FTIR, WAXD and ESEM. Increasing the salt level enhances the mechanical strength of starch in the glassy state and shifts the glass transition temperature to a higher value. Antiplasticising effects of NaCl and CaCl2 on the non-phosphorylated tapioca starch are indistinguishable from each other. Observations are complemented by intensification of absorbance peaks in FTIR spectra and a systematic change in shape and intensity of diffraction patterns with increasing addition of salt consistent with interactions between added ions and macromolecule.

TI Formation of friable embryogenic callus in cassava is enhanced under
   conditions of reduced nitrate, potassium and phosphate
SO PLOS ONE
AB Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is an important research tool for the genetic improvement of cassava. The induction of friable embryogenic callus (FEC) is considered as a key step in cassava transformation. In the present study, the media composition was optimized for enhancing the FEC induction, and the effect of the optimized medium on gene expression was evaluated. In relative comparison to MS medium, results demonstrated that using a medium with reducing nutrition (a 10-fold less concentration of nitrogen, potassium, and phosphate), the increased amount of vitamin B1 (10 mg/L) and the use of picrolam led to reprogram non-FEC to FEC. Gene expression analyses revealed that FEC on modified media increased the expression of genes related to the regulation of polysaccharide biosynthesis and breakdown of cell wall components in comparison to FEC on normal CIM media, whereas the gene expression associated with energy flux was not dramatically altered. It is hypothesized that we reprogram non-FEC to FEC under low nitrogen, potassium and phosphate and high vitamin B1. These findings were more effective in inducing FEC formation than the previous protocol. It might contribute to development of an efficient transformation strategy in cassava.

TI Ground penetrating radar: a case study for estimating root bulking rate
   in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz)
SO PLANT METHODS
AB Background: Understanding root traits is a necessary research front for selection of favorable genotypes or cultivation practices. Root and tuber crops having most of their economic potential stored below ground are favorable candidates for such studies. The ability to image and quantify subsurface root structure would allow breeders to classify root traits for rapid selection and allow agronomist the ability to derive effective cultivation practices. In spite of the huge role of Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), for food security and industrial uses, little progress has been made in understanding the onset and rate of the root-bulking process and the factors that influence it. The objective of this research was to determine the capability of ground penetrating radar (GPR) to predict root-bulking rates through the detection of total root biomass during its growth cycle. Our research provides the first application of GPR for detecting below ground biomass in cassava.
   Results: Through an empirical study, linear regressions were derived to model cassava bulking rates. The linear equations derived suggest that GPR is a suitable measure of root biomass (r =.79). The regression analysis developed accounts for 63% of the variability in cassava biomass below ground. When modeling is performed at the variety level, it is evident that the variety models for SM 1219-9 and TMS 60444 outperform the HMC-1 variety model (r(2) =.77,.63 and.51 respectively).
   Conclusions: Using current modeling methods, it is possible to predict below ground biomass and estimate root bulking rates for selection of early root bulking in cassava. Results of this approach suggested that the general model was over predicting at early growth stages but became more precise in later root development.

TI Genuine antiplasticizing effect of water on a glass-former drug
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Water is the most important plasticizer of biological and organic hydrophilic materials, which generally exhibit enhanced mechanical softness and molecular mobility upon hydration. The enhancement of the molecular dynamics upon mixing with water, which in glass-forming systems implies a lower glass transition temperature (T-g), is considered a universal result of hydration. In fact, even in the cases where hydration or humidification of an organic glass-forming sample result in stiffer mechanical properties, the molecular mobility of the sample almost always increases with increasing water content, and its T-g decreases correspondingly. Here, we present an experimental report of a genuine antiplasticizing effect of water on the molecular dynamics of a small-molecule glass former. In detail, we show that addition of water to prilocaine, an active pharmaceutical ingredient, has the same effect as that of an applied pressure, namely, a decrease in mobility and an increase of T-g. We assign the antiplasticizing effect to the formation of prilocaine-H2O dimers or complexes with enhanced hydrogen bonding interactions.

TI Variations of five eIF4E genes across cassava accessions exhibiting
   tolerant and susceptible responses to cassava brown streak disease
SO PLOS ONE
AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is an important tropical subsistence crop that is severely affected by cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) in East Africa. The disease is caused by Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV). Both have a (+)-sense single-stranded RNA genome with a 5' covalently-linked viral protein, which functionally resembles the cap structure of mRNA, binds to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) or its analogues, and then enable the translation of viral genomic RNA in host cells. To characterize cassava eIF4Es and their potential role in CBSD tolerance and susceptibility, we cloned five eIF4E transcripts from cassava (accession TMS60444). Sequence analysis indicated that the cassava eIF4E family of proteins consisted of one eIF4E, two eIF(iso) 4E, and two divergent copies of novel cap-binding proteins (nCBPs). Our data demonstrated experimentally the coding of these five genes as annotated in the published cassava genome and provided additional evidence for refined annotations. Illumina resequencing data of the five eIF4E genes were analyzed from 14 cassava lines tolerant or susceptible to CBSD. Abundant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and biallelic variations were observed in the eIF4E genes; however, most of the SNPs were located in the introns and non-coding regions of the exons. Association studies of non-synonymous SNPs revealed no significant association between any SNP of the five eIF4E genes and the tolerance or susceptibility to CBSD. However, two SNPs in two genes were weakly associated with the CBSD responses but had no direct causal-effect relationship. SNPs in an intergenic region upstream of eIF4E_me showed a surprising strong association with CBSD responses. Digital expression profile analysis showed differential expression of different eIF4E genes but no significant difference in gene expression was found between susceptible and tolerant cassava accessions despite the association of the intergenic SNPs with CBSD responses.

TI Exergetic and economic evaluation of incorporation of hydrogen
   production in a cassava wastewater plant
SO APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING
AB The use of bioenergy has become a good alternative to reduce the emission of polluting gases. In Brazil, this type of energy has increased in the last years. Hydrogen has presented itself as an alternative fuel in relation to fossil fuels, becoming economically competitive. Informations on the viability of biohydrogen production using wastewater from cassava processing is very limited. This paper analyzes the exergetic and economic efficiency of the biohydrogen production using cassava wastewater from a large-scale plant, through a computer simulation of the process performed by the reformer using the software HYSYS (version 8.0). The exergetic analysis revealed that the Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) is the step with highest irreversibility, being responsible for 85.7% of all exergy destroyed in the productive process. The study showed that the global exergetic efficiency of the plant was 79%, which is a good value in comparison to others in the literature. The economic feasibility calculation was performed to evaluate how interesting the process is by analyzing the investment, operation and maintenance costs of the biogas steam reformer and the hydrogen production cost achieved the value of 0.13 US$/kWh with a payback period of 7 years. The results obtained by these analyses showed that this type of hydrogen production is a good choice for power generation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Protein feeding of Queensland fruit fly Bactrocera tryoni and cucumber
   fly Zeugodacus cucumis (Diptera: Tephritidae) on non-host vegetation:
   effect of plant species and bait height
SO AUSTRAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB Perimeter-baiting of non-crop vegetation using toxic protein baits was developed overseas as a technique for control of melon fly, Zeugodacus (Zeugodacus) cucurbitae (Coquillett) (formerly Bactrocera (Zeugodacus) cucurbitae), and evidence suggests that this technique may also be effective in Australia for control of local fruit fly species in vegetable crops. Using field cage trials and laboratory reared flies, primary data were generated to support this approach by testing fruit flies' feeding response to protein when applied to eight plant species (forage sorghum, grain sorghum, sweet corn, sugarcane, eggplant, cassava, lilly pilly and orange jessamine) and applied at three heights (1, 1.5 and 2m). When compared across the plants, Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt), most commonly fed on protein bait applied to sugarcane and cassava, whereas more cucumber fly, Zeugodacus (Austrodacus) cucumis (French) (formerly Bactrocera (Austrodacus) cucumis), fed on bait applied to sweet corn and forage sorghum. When protein bait was applied at different heights, B.tryoni responded most to bait placed in the upper part of the plants (2m), whereas Z. cucumis preferred bait placed lower on the plants (1 and 1.5m). These results have implications for optimal placement of protein bait for best practice control of fruit flies in vegetable crops and suggest that the two species exhibit different foraging behaviours.

TI Tackling agriculturally relevant diseases in the staple crop cassava
   (Manihot esculenta)
SO CURRENT OPINION IN PLANT BIOLOGY
AB Cassava is an important staple food crop for millions of people in tropical regions across Africa, South America and Asia. Viral, bacterial and fungal diseases impact cassava yield in all three regions. The viruses causing cassava mosaic disease and cassava brown streak disease have been particularly devastating to cassava production in Africa. Improved farming practices and disease monitoring can reduce the impact of cassava diseases in the field. The availability of disease resistant cassava varieties developed through breeding or genetic engineering is key to tackling disease incidence and severity.

TI High throughput phenotyping to accelerate crop breeding and monitoring
   of diseases in the field
SO CURRENT OPINION IN PLANT BIOLOGY
AB Effective implementation of technology that facilitates accurate and high-throughput screening of thousands of field-grown lines is critical for accelerating crop improvement and breeding strategies for higher yield and disease tolerance. Progress in the development of field-based high throughput phenotyping methods has advanced considerably in the last 10 years through technological progress in sensor development and high-performance computing. Here, we review recent advances in high throughput field phenotyping technologies designed to inform the genetics of quantitative traits, including crop yield and disease tolerance. Successful application of phenotyping platforms to advance crop breeding and identify and monitor disease requires: (1) high resolution of imaging and environmental sensors; (2) quality data products that facilitate computer vision, machine learning and GIS; (3) capacity infrastructure for data management and analysis; and (4) automated environmental data collection. Accelerated breeding for agriculturally relevant crop traits is key to the development of improved varieties and is critically dependent on high-resolution, high-throughput field-scale phenotyping technologies that can efficiently discriminate better performing lines within a larger population and across multiple environments.

TI Effect of growth period on the multi-scale structure and physicochemical
   properties of cassava starch
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB Starches were isolated from South China 5 (SC5) cassava harvested for 7, 8, 9,10 and 11 months. During growth, the granule size, lamellar structure, crystalline structure and digestibility changed slightly, while the amylose content varied between 20.93% and 22.61%. However, the molecular weight showed an obvious increase as the harvesting time increased to 9 months, and then decreased during 9-11 months. The pasting behaviors were greatly affected by harvesting time. A shorter growth time led to higher pasting temperature, and lower peak, breakdown and setback viscosities. This trend became contrary when the growth time prolonged from 9 to 11 months. Hence, the starch harvested at 9 months showed the lowest pasting temperature (64.6 degrees C), but highest paste viscosity (2105 cP) and retrogradation tendency. All these results confirm that the growth time of 9 months was the turning point for the physicochemical features of SC5 during growth. This study provides fundamental data for rationally tailoring cassava starch properties by simply controlling the harvest time. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of dust accumulation and module cleaning on performance ratio of
   solar rooftop system and solar power plants
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Thailand is an agricultural country, with rice, sugar, and cassava as the major export products. Production of rice, sugar cane, and cassava entails agricultural activities that give rise to significant airborne dusts. In this work, five photovoltaic (PV) units (one solar rooftop and four power plants) are selected for the study. From the study of dust accumulation on glass surface located near rice farms, it was found that opaque areas due to the deposition of dust are 11-14% after 1-2-week exposure. As a consequence, PV system performance is affected. Performance ratio was calculated to determine these effects. Overall results reveal that during the dry and hot seasons, dust deposition significantly affects the performance ratio. The performance ratio reduces by 1.6-3% for 1-month dust accumulation and reduces by 6-8% for 2-month dust accumulation. After cleaning the dust accumulated, the performance ratio greatly increases, resulting in the increase in the energy output by 10%. This increase provides economic and cost benefits of PV cleaning. The performance ratio is not significantly changed during the rainy season, which PV modules are relatively clean as the dust is washed away by rain. It was also found that most of the solar power plants in Thailand still rely on manual cleaning of PV modules with washing water followed by wiping. However, only one power plant, employs a machine for cleaning, resulting in lower cleaning costs. (C) 2017 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

TI Two transcriptional activators of N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase
   2 and melatonin biosynthesis in cassava
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB Similar to the situation in animals, melatonin biosynthesis is regulated by four sequential enzymatic steps in plants. Although the melatonin synthesis genes have been identified in various plants, the upstream transcription factors of them remain unknown. In this study on cassava (Manihot esculenta), we found that MeWRKY79 and heat-shock transcription factor 20 (MeHsf20) targeted the W-box and the heat-stress elements (HSEs) in the promoter of N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase 2 (MeASMT2), respectively. The interaction between MeWRKY79, MeHsf20, and the MeASMT2 promoter was evidenced by the activation of promoter activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in cassava protoplasts, and by an in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The transcripts of MeWRKY79, MeHsf20, and MeASMT2 were all regulated by a 22-amino acid flagellin peptide (flg22) and by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv manihotis (Xam). In common with the phenotype of MeASMT2, transient expression of MeWRKY79 and MeHsf20 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves conferred improved disease resistance. Through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in cassava, we found that MeWRKY79- and MeHsf20-silenced plants showed lower transcripts of MeASMT2 and less accumulation of melatonin, which resulted in disease sensitivity that could be reversed by exogenous melatonin. Taken together, these results indicate that MeASMT2 is a target of MeWRKY79 and MeHsf20 in plant disease resistance. This study identifies novel upstream transcription factors of melatonin synthesis genes in cassava, thus extending our knowledge of the complex modulation of melatonin synthesis in plant defense.

TI EFFECT OF PLASTICIZER AND MODIFIED STARCH ON BIODEGRADABLE FILMS FOR
   STRAWBERRY PROTECTION
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION
AB In this study, cassava starch-based films were produced to protect strawberries. Nine films from natural and modified starches (oxidized and acetylated) mixed to gelatin and plasticizers (sorbitol, glycerol and mannitol) were prepared for strawberry protection after harvesting. The films were homogeneous, transparent and flexible, and the ones that presented the best results were prepared with sorbitol because they presented mass loss indices ranging from 28.17 to 32.96%, after 8-day storage. These values were lower in the control group (without film) that had 53.44% loss. The results indicate a 5-day increase of strawberry shelf life. Regarding color, a difference was verified only in the L* index (brightness) when the coated fruits had lighter color than the control ones. These results show the great potential of film utilization in food preservation, aggregating value to the agricultural activity and helping to reduce nonbiodegradable films in the environment.

   ITS ANTIOXIDANT STABILITY DURING STORAGE
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION
AB The moisture sorption isotherm of vacuum dried culinary banana flour was studied using standard static-gravimetric technique at five different temperatures (25-45C). There was a gradual increase in equilibrium moisture content (EMC) between 0.1 and 0.65 water activities (a(w)), and EMC increased beyond 0.65 aw led to type II isotherm of sigmoidal characteristics. The effect of temperature on EMC was not significant at P > 0.05. Among the seven models fitted, Peleg model showed the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) with lower values of relative deviations (R-d<10%) and fulfilled the necessary criteria desired for the model and best fitted. The net isosteric heat of sorption (q(st)) determined from the equilibrium sorption data using Clausius-Clapeyron equation showed the decreasing trend of qst with increasing EMC. Additionally, the antioxidant and polyphenols stability of culinary banana flour monitored at 25C showed minor degradation up to 120 days without affecting its bioactive properties.

TI Combination of Poly(lactic) Acid and Starch for Biodegradable Food
   Packaging
SO MATERIALS
AB The massive use of synthetic plastics, in particular in the food packaging area, has a great environmental impact, and alternative more ecologic materials are being required. Poly(lactic) acid (PLA) and starch have been extensively studied as potential replacements for non-degradable petrochemical polymers on the basis of their availability, adequate food contact properties and competitive cost. Nevertheless, both polymers exhibit some drawbacks for packaging uses and need to be adapted to the food packaging requirements. Starch, in particular, is very water sensitive and its film properties are heavily dependent on the moisture content, exhibiting relatively low mechanical resistance. PLA films are very brittle and offer low resistance to oxygen permeation. Their combination as blend or multilayer films could provide properties that are more adequate for packaging purposes on the basis of their complementary characteristics. The main characteristics of PLA and starch in terms of not only the barrier and mechanical properties of their films but also of their combinations, by using blending or multilayer strategies, have been analyzed, identifying components or processes that favor the polymer compatibility and the good performance of the combined materials. The properties of some blends/combinations have been discussed in comparison with those of pure polymer films.

TI Ruminal parameters and nitrogen balance in fed cattle feeding with
   cassava root silage
SO PESQUISA VETERINARIA BRASILEIRA
AB The effect of inclusion of cassava root silage on ruminal parameters and nitrogenous compounds in dairy cattle was evaluated. Five cattle cannulated in the rumen and with average body weight of 389 kg were distributed into a Latin square 5x5, with five levels of inclusion (0.00, 3.62, 7.23, 10.84 and 14.54% of the diet dry matter) of cassava root silage and five periods (10 days for adaptation and five days for data collection). The nitrogen excretion in urine and feces were not affected (P>0.05) by inclusion of cassava root silage in the diet. The total nitrogen intake (CNT) and nitrogen balance (NB) showed an increasing quadratic and linear behavior, respectively. The lowest CNT (142.14g/day) was obtained with the inclusion of 5.82% silage cassava root. The concentration of urea (U) and urea nitrogen (UN) in plasma and urine did not change (P>0.05). There was a quadratic behavior (P<0.05) in excreta of U and NU in the urine, with minimum point of 131.13 and 61.20g/day respectively, at the level of 7.27% inclusion of the cassava root silage. No interaction (P>0.05) was between the levels of cassava root silage and the collection time of rumen contents for the short-chain fatty acids, pH and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N). Only the N-NH3 protein showed quadratic behavior, according to the inclusion levels, with the minimum point (12.62mg/100ml of rumen contents) at the level of 5.98%. The level of 7.23% of cassava root silage in the diet was more efficient with the use of nitrogen compounds. The diets contribute similarly to the production of short chain fatty acids, without disturbing the rumen pH.

TI Food security implications of staple food substitution in Sahelian West
   Africa
SO FOOD POLICY
AB Low-income households in Sahelian West Africa face multiple shocks that risk compressing their already low food consumption levels. This paper develops a multi-market simulation model to evaluate the impact of common production and world-price shocks on food consumption of vulnerable groups in Sahelian West Africa. Empirical analysis confirms that poor households bear the brunt of ensuing consumption risks, particularly in closed markets, where trade barriers restrict imports, and the poor find themselves in a bidding war with richer consumers for limited food supplies. In the absence of trade, a drought that reduces domestic rainfed cereal production by 20% would compress already low calorie consumption of the rural poor by as much as 15%, four times as much as other household groups. Conversely, a 50% spike in world rice prices hits the urban poor hardest, compressing calorie consumption by up to 8%.
   Policy responses need to focus on two basic mechanisms that can help to moderate this pressure consumer substitution among staple foods and trade. Immediately south of the Sahel, coastal West African countries enjoy higher rainfall, dual rainy seasons, more stable staple food production based on root crops (cassava and yams) as well as frequent double cropping of maize.
   Our simulation results suggest that regional trade in maize, yams and cassava-based prepared foods like gari and attieke could fill over one-third of the consumption shortfall resulting from a major drought in the Sahel. Increasing substitutability across starchy staples, for example through expansion of maize, cassava and sorghum-based convenience foods, would further moderate consumption pressure by expanding the array of food alternatives and hence supply responses available during periods of stress.

TI Selection of cassava accessions with multiple resistance to pathogens
   associated with root rot disease
SO EUPHYTICA
AB Cassava root rot disease (CRRD) severely affects productivity in several countries. The objective of this study was to estimate genetic parameters and to identify multiple resistance sources against pathogens associated with CRRD. The symptoms caused by Fusarium spp., Phytophthora spp., and Botryosphaeriaceae species in peel and pulp from the roots were evaluated in 277 accessions using a whole tuberous root inoculation method. The resistance data were obtained by REML/BLUP (restricted maximum like-lihood/best linear unbiased predictor). The classic selection index (CI), multiplicative (MI), and sum of ranks (SRI) were used to identify the accessions with multiple resistance. For all pathogens, the environmental variance (sigma(2)(e)) was the most important component. Individual heritability h(g)(2) was of low magnitude for resistance to most pathogens (0.16 +/- 0.02-peel and 0.31 +/- 0.03-pulp for Fusarium spp.; 0.26 +/- 0.03-peel and 0.30 +/- 0.03-pulp for Phytophthora spp.; and 0.28 +/- 0.03-peel and 0.27 +/- 0.03-pulp for Botryosphaereacea species). The distribution of CRRD symptoms indicated the presence of quantitative inheritance. The direct selection of the 15 more resistant accessions based on the genotypic predicted values result in high reductions of disease (>50%). However, there was a low matching rate of the most resistant accessions for each pathogen and the different parts of the tuberous roots (peel and pulp). The CI and MI were the most promising compared to the SRI to ensure high and balanced resistance for each pathogen. Understanding the genetic basis of resistance to CRRD and the identification of sources with multiple resistance may be useful in various management strategies to control the disease.

TI Evaluation of cassava germplasm for drought tolerance under field
   conditions
SO EUPHYTICA
AB The development of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) with a high yield under water-deficit conditions is one of the goal of the breeding programs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance and to select cassava accessions based on drought tolerance indices and productive potential under water stress. Forty-nine accessions were evaluated for five agronomic traits (plant height-PH, root yield-RoY, shoot yield-ShY, harvest index-HI; and dry matter content of roots-DMC) under full irrigation conditions and drought stress (DS). The accessions were selected based on: (i) high yield under drought conditions (HY-DS) and (ii) high drought tolerance (Dr-To) based on six different indices. Overall, water stress dramatically reduced the traits' means (RoY-72.98%, ShY-54.95%, DMC-26.15%, HI-31.05%, and PH-32.95%). Low coincidence among the top ten accessions was identified based on HY-DS and Dr-To criteria. Therefore, considering only the most important traits (RoY and ShY), five accessions (BGM0815, BGM0598, 9624-09, BGM0818, and BRS Formosa) presented high HY-DS. In contrast, to Dr-To criterion, eight and nine accessions were selected for high yield of the aerial part (ShY and PH) and roots (RoY and DMC), respectively. The mean productivity, geometric mean productivity, and drought tolerance indices were the most promising to identify genotypes with high agronomic attributes, while drought susceptibility index, susceptibility, and yield stability index were suitable to identify the most drought tolerant accessions. This set of selected accessions can be used in breeding programs aimed at high yield and drought tolerance.

TI CASSAVA GROWING IN GREENHOUSE: EFFECTS ON YIELD AND QUALITY OF STORAGE
   ROOTS
SO INTERCIENCIA
AB Due to the strong interaction between ambient temperature and cassava yields, in subtropical regions greenhouse culture can be considered as an appropriate production technology in order to increase root yield and anticipate harvest. The aim of this work was to evaluate quantitatively and qualitatively the production of cassava storage roots (SR) in a sandy soil of Corrientes, Argentina, under greenhouse. For this purpose, temporal variations of yield components, harvest index (HI), contents of starch, protein, crude fiber and minerals in SR of three cassava cultivars (Blanca de Santa Catarina, Ramada Paso and Rocha) were studied. The experiment was conducted under a randomized complete block design with three replications. SR fresh weight per plant showed a sign (cant genotype-time interaction. The number of SR significantly varied between cultivars and remained constant over time in 'each one of them. All IC obtained exceeded 0.5 after 193 days of plantation. The starch content did not differ between genotypes, while Blanca de Santa Catarina and Rocha yielded the earliest. There were negative relationships between time and protein content and crude fiber, and a very high association between the last ones. No statistical differences in mineral content with respect to time were recorded. It is feasible to produce cassava in greenhouses achieving high yields and early harvests.

TI Yield loss management through fertilizers in Banana bract mosaic virus
   affected French plantain cv. Nendran (AAB)
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB Plant virus infection significantly reduces the yield of many horticultural crops causing reduction in the production and productivity. Higher fertilizer application has often to overcome the yield reduction due to virus in many crops. A field experiment was conducted to find out the effect of increased doses of fertilizers on the banana bract mosaic virus (BBrMV) infected plants of French plantain cv. Nendran. The plant height, girth, number of leaves, number of fingers and the bunch weight had significantly increased with increased dose of fertilizer in the first and second crops with BBrMV infection. In the first crop, with the application of 125 and 150% of recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF), the BBrMV infected plants could produce bunches which were on par with that of healthy plants, receiving 100% RDF, but with prolonged days of flowering. In the second crop, though 125 and 150% RDF doses in the infected plants increased the bunch weight over 100% RDF by 14.60% and 18.33%, respectively, could not be able to compensate the yield loss due to virus infection. This may probably be due to the accumulation of virus over the period of two years. This is the first report on strategies for mitigating adverse effects of BBrMV in plantain.

TI Inactivation kinetics and conformation change of Hypocrea orientalis
   beta-glucosidase with guanidine hydrochloride
SO JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCE AND BIOENGINEERING
AB The relationship between unfolding and inactivation of Hypocrea orientalis beta-glucosidase has been investigated for the first time. The secretion of beta-glucosidase from H. orientalis is induced by raw cassava residues. The enzyme was 75 kD without glycosylation. Guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) could reversibly inactivate the enzyme with an estimated IC50 value of 0.4 M. The inactivation kinetics model by GuHCl has been established and the microscopic inactivation rate constants are determined. The values of forward inactivation rate constants of free enzyme are found to be larger than that of substrate-enzyme complex suggesting the enzyme could be protected by substrate during denaturation. Conformational change of the enzyme during denaturation is observed as the intrinsic fluorescence emission peaks appeared red-shift (334-354 nm) with intensity decreased following increase of GuHCl concentrations. Inactivation extent is found to be greater than conformation change of the whole enzyme, indicating that the active site of H. orientalis beta-glucosidase might be a more flexible region than the whole enzyme.

TI Near-Atomic Resolution Structure of a Plant Geminivirus Determined by
   Electron Cryomicroscopy
SO STRUCTURE
AB African cassava mosaic virus is a whitefly-transmitted geminivirus which forms unique twin particles of incomplete icosahedra that are joined at five-fold vertices, building an unusual waist. How its 22 capsomers interact within a half-capsid or across the waist is unknown thus far. Using electron cryomicroscopy and image processing, we determined the virion structure with a resolution of 4.2 angstrom and built an atomic model for its capsid protein. The inter-capsomer contacts mediated by the flexible N termini and loop regions differed within the half-capsids and at the waist, explaining partly the unusual twin structure. The tip of the pentameric capsomer is sealed by a plug formed by a turn region harboring the evolutionary conserved residue Y193. Basic amino acid residues inside the capsid form a positively charged pocket next to the five-fold axis of the capsomer suitable for binding DNA. Within this pocket, density most likely corresponding to DNA was resolved.

TI An ethnographic exploration of perceptions of changes in dietary variety
   in the Kolli Hills, India
SO FOOD SECURITY
AB The Malayalis Tribe, a Scheduled Tribe of the Kolli Hills in southern India, has experienced a decrease in the variety of foods consumed in the past 20 years. It is important to understand these changes in dietary patterns to inform future interventions to improve dietary diversity. This study aimed to investigate the perceived factors and experiences from participants belonging to different age groups and genders that have affected changes in dietary variety in the Kolli Hills over the past 20 years. An ethnographic approach was used for the study. Data collection methods included semi-structured focus group discussions, informal individual interviews, and participant observations. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze themes related to the research questions. Results suggest that dietary diversity has declined and a smaller number of foods are consumed from grain products, fruits, vegetables and meat products. The main reasons for the decrease in dietary variety include an increased reliance on market systems (linked with an increase in cassava cash cropping) to obtain food and a lack of financial resources to purchase a variety of foods for consumption. Intergenerational changes in taste preferences influenced the types of foods consumed in the household. Drudgery associated with preparing traditional millets for consumption made it a less favorable choice in comparison to subsidized rice purchased through Fair Price Shops. The findings from this study are important to understand the changes in dietary patterns from the perspective of community members and will help inform future interventions to improve dietary diversity in the Kolli Hills.

TI Physiological determinants of storage root yield in three cassava
   genotypes under different nitrogen supply
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB Physiological traits can be used to improve the efficiency of selecting suitable genotypes to grow under nitrogen (N) limitation. The objective of the current study was to investigate the relationship between physiological characteristics and storage root yield of three cassava genotypes under three rates of N fertilizer. The experiments were conducted from 2014 to 2016 at farm fields in Thailand. A split-plot randomized complete block design with four replications was used. Three different rates of N fertilizer, i.e., 46.9, 90.0 and 133.2 kg N/ha and three cassava genotypes, Rayong 9, Rayong 11 and Kasetsart 50, were used. Kasetsart 50 had the highest mean performance for most crop traits. Growth rate of stem (SGR), storage root (SRGR) and crop (CGR) during 180-210 days after planting (DAP) and leaf area index (LAI) at 120 DAP were related to storage root dry weight for all three rates of N fertilizer. Storage root growth during 90-120 DAP, CGR during 180-210 DAP and specific leaf area (SLA) at 210 DAP contributed most to storage root dry weight of the three genotypes grown at 46.9 kg N/ha, while the combination of SRGR during 90-120 DAP, SRGR during 180-210 DAP, LAI at 210 DAP and SLA at 210 DAP was best for N fertilizer at 90.0 kg N/ha and the combination of leaf growth rate (LGR) during 180-210 DAP and LAI at 210 DAP was best for N fertilizer at 133.2 kg N/ha.

TI Cassava/sugar palm fiber reinforced cassava starch hybrid composites:
   Physical, thermal and structural properties
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB A hybrid composite was prepared from cassava bagasse (CB) and sugar palm fiber (SPF) using casting technique with cassava starch (CS) as matrix and fructose as a plasticizer. Different loadings of SPF (2, 4, 6 and 8% w/w of dry starch) were added to the CS/CB composite film containing 6% CB. The addition of SPF significantly influenced the physical properties. It increased the thickness while decreasing the density, water content, water solubility and water absorption. However, no significant effect was noticed on the thermal properties of the hybrid composite film. The incorporation of SPF increased the relative crystallinity up to 47%, compared to 32% of the CS film. SEM micrographs indicated that the filler was incorporated in the matrix. The film with a higher concentration of SPF (CS-CB/SPF8) showed a more heterogeneous surface. It could be concluded that the incorporation of SPF led to changes in cassava starch film properties, potentially affecting the film performances. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Kinetics of the Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Sweet Cassava Starch, Bitter
   Cassava, and Gadung (Dioscorea hispida Dennst) Flours at Low Temperature
SO BULLETIN OF CHEMICAL REACTION ENGINEERING AND CATALYSIS
AB Starch is a potential substrate for this purpose, but the extra cost is needed to hydrolyze it into reducing sugar. As an alternative to the expensive and energy demanding conventional hydrolysis process, the low-temperature hydrolysis is being studied. Granular starch hydrolyzing enzyme (GSHE) was used in the process to degrade starch into reducing sugar at 30 degrees C and pH 4. The substrates included sweet cassava starch, bitter cassava, and gadung (Dioscorea hispida Dennst) flours. Starch concentrations studied were in the range 50-400 g/L, respectively, while the concentration of enzyme was maintained at 1.5 % (w/w). The optimum productivity of reducing sugar (Q(rs)) of sweet cassava starch, bitter cassava, and gadung flours were 4.11, 3.10, and 0.52 (g/L.h), respectively. The Michaelis-Menten constants (K-m) for these three substrates were determined as 139.84 g/L, 141.43 g/L, and 140.92 g/L for sweet cassava starch, bitter cassava, and gadung flours, respectively. Increasing of cyanide concentration during hydrolysis process of sweet cassava starch, bitter cassava, and gadung flours decreased V-max, significantly. Based on Lineweaver-Burk plot for sweet cassava starch, bitter cassava, and gadung flours (50-400 g/L) with the cyanide concentration of 42, 168, and 176 mg/kg, can be classified as noncompetitive inhibition with K-I value of 0.0317.

TI Morphology, transport characteristics and viscoelastic polymer chain
   confinement in nanocomposites based on thermoplastic potato starch and
   cellulose nanofibers from pineapple leaf
SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB Eco-friendly "green" nano composites were fabricated from potato starch and cellulose nanofibers from pineapple leaf. Nanocomposites of starch/cellulose nanofibers were prepared by solution mixing followed by casting. The investigation of the viscoelastic properties confirms starch macromolecular chain confinement around the nano scale cellulose surface, superior dispersion and very good interaction between thermoplastic starch and cellulose nanofibers. The degree of chain confinement was quantified. The chain confinement was associated with the immobilization of the starch macromolecular chains in the network formed by the nano-scale cellulose fibers as a result of hydrogen boding interactions. From the results, it was assumed that the starch glycerol system exhibits a heterogenous nature and cellulose nanofibers tend to move towards glycerol rich starch phase. Barrier properties also improved with the addition of nanofiller up to 3 wt.% but further addition depreciated properties due to possible fiber agglomeration. The kinetics of diffusion was investigated and typical kinetic parameters were determined and found that the nanocomposites follow pseudo fickian behaviour. The outcome of the work confirms that the prepared nanocomposites films can be used as a swap for packaging applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO FOOD CONTROL
AB Attieke is a steamed fermented cassava semolina and food now included in many African countries habits. Non-control of production factors is an important constraint causing manufacturing defaults. Moreover, toxic varieties are used in fermented foods.
   The aim of this study was to characterize and optimize microbiological, physicochemical and biochemical qualities of attieke Ebrie. The analyses were performed on traditional inoculum and 4 cassava varieties.
   The lactic fermentation of cassava dough had positive impact on microbiological and chemical qualities of prepared attieke that showed slight acidity (pH = 4.6), high starch (80-90 g/100 g) and low cyanide contents (2.79-5.00 mg/kg). Therefore, sweet varieties are suitable for preparing attieke (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Sesame cake incorporation on cassava starch foams for packaging use
SO INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB Baked foams based on cassava starch added with sesame cake, a byproduct of the oil industry, were developed and evaluated regarding the effects of residue addition on the morphological, physical and mechanical properties of these materials. The foams were prepared by thermal expansion process using different sesame residue concentrations, with blend ratios of 90/10, 80/20, 70/30 and 60/40 (m/m). The addition of sesame cake improved mechanical properties and reduced density and water capacity absorption in comparison to foams made using only starch. Furthermore, foams developed with higher residue concentrations (>20%) exhibited most suitable combination of mechanical properties when compared to commercial expanded polystyrene (EPS). Whilst improvements in flexibility and moisture sensibility are still necessary, starch-based foams incorporated with sesame cake can be an alternative for packing dry foods and foods with low moisture content, reducing the EPS use.

AB Orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) is known to be a rich source of beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A and a potential tool for fighting vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in developing countries. OFSP flour was incorporated into wheat flour at 10, 20 and 30% (w/w) substitution levels. The stability of beta-carotene during baking and the contribution of OFSP-wheat composite breads to vitamin A requirements were evaluated. The retention of all-trans-beta-carotene in breads containing 10, 20 and 30% OFSP flour was 62.7, 71.4 and 83% respectively, after baking. Breads containing 20% and 30% OFSP flour could be used for the eradication of vitamin A deficiency as they were found to meet 29 and 89.2% (100 g portion) respectively, of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin A amongst children aged 3-10 years. The latter would meet nearly a half of the RDA of vitamin A for pregnant and lactating women. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Mechanism of cassava tuber cell wall weakening by dilute sodium
   hydroxide steeping
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB Steeping of cassava root pieces in 0.75% NaOH in combination with wet milling was investigated to determine whether and how dilute NaOH modifies cassava cell walls. Gas chromatography data of cell wall constituent sugar composition and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) data showed that NaOH steeping reduced the level of pectin in cassava cell walls. FTIR and wide-angle X-ray scattering spectroscopy also indicated that NaOH steeping combined with fine milling slightly reduced cellulose crystallinity. Scanning electron microscopy showed that NaOH steeping produced micropores in the cell walls and light microscopy revealed that NaOH steeping increased disaggregation of parenchyma cells. Steeping of ground cassava in NaOH resulted in a 12% decrease in large residue particles and approx. 4% greater starch yield with wet milling. Therefore dilute NaOH steeping can improve the effectiveness of wet milling in disintegrating cell walls through solubilisation of pectin, thereby reduced cell wall strength. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI MeSAUR1, Encoded by a Small Auxin-Up RNA Gene, Acts as a Transcription
   Regulator to Positively Regulate ADP-Glucose Pyrophosphorylase Small
   Subunit1a Gene in Cassava
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Cassava, being one of the top three tuberous crops, features highly efficient starch accumulation in the storage root to adapt the tropical resources and environments. The molecular mechanism for the process, however, is still unclear. ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, the first and rate-limited enzyme in starch biosynthesis pathway, is a heterotetramer comprised of two small/catalytic and two large/modulatory subunits. To understand the regulation of MeAGPase, the promoter of a highly expressed small subunit, MeAGPs1a, was used as bait for a yeast one-hybrid assay to screen storage root cDNA library. One cDNA, coding for a small auxin-up RNA protein, named MeSAUR1, was isolated from cassava. MeSAUR1 could bind to the promoter of MeAGPS1a in yeast one-hybrid test and in vitro, and was located in cell nucleus. MeSAUR1 displayed a higher transcript level in cassava root cortex, and its expression was induced by indole-3-acetic acid, gibberellin and ethylene, but repressed by abscisic acid. A dual-luciferase interaction test further convinced that MeSAUR1 could bind to the promoter of MeAGPS1a, and positively regulate the transcription of MeAGPS1a in cassava.

TI Vegetable fillers for electric stimuli responsive elastomers
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) have been studied widely in recent years for artificial muscle applications, but their implementation into production is limited due to high operating voltages required. The actuation behavior of dielectric elastomer under an applied electric field is predicted by Maxwell's pressure and thickness strain equations. According to these equations, the best electromechanical response is achieved when the relative permittivity is high and elastic modulus is low. The potential source for additives increasing the relative permittivity of rubbers can be vegetable powders that have much higher dielectric constant than common elastomers. In the present research, the dielectric and actuation properties of polyacrylate rubber (ACM) were studied after the addition of different vegetable-based fillers such as potato starch, corn starch, garlic, and paprika. The results were compared to ACM filled with barium titanate. The compounds containing vegetable fillers showed higher relative dielectric permittivity at 1 Hz frequency than the compounds containing barium titanate due to higher interfacial polarization. The actuation studies showed that lower electric fields are required to generate certain actuation forces when the starches and garlic are used in the rubber instead of barium titanate. Therefore, the vegetable-based fillers can be used to improve actuation performance of DEAs. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2017, 134, 45081.

TI Overexpression of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene improves
   floral development in cassava (Manihot esculenta, Crantz)
SO PLOS ONE
AB Cassava is a tropical storage-root crop that serves as a worldwide source of staple food for over 800 million people. Flowering is one of the most important breeding challenges in cassava because in most lines flowering is late and non-synchronized, and flower production is sparse. The FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene is pivotal for floral induction in all examined angiosperms. The objective of the current work was to determine the potential roles of the FT signaling system in cassava. The Arabidopsis thaliana FT gene (atFT) was transformed into the cassava cultivar 60444 through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and was found to be overexpressed constitutively. FT overexpression hastened flower initiation and associated fork-type branching, indicating that cassava has the necessary signaling factors to interact with and respond to the atFT gene product. In addition, overexpression stimulated lateral branching, increased the prolificacy of flower production and extended the longevity of flower development. While FT homologs in some plant species stimulate development of vegetative storage organs, atFT inhibited storage-root development and decreased root harvest index in cassava. These findings collectively contribute to our understanding of flower development in cassava and have the potential for applications in breeding.

TI Farmer variety exchange along Amazonian rivers influences the genetic
   structure of manioc maintained in a regional Brazilian GeneBank
SO GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH
AB Knowledge of agro-morphological and genetic variability of germplasm diversity is a prerequisite for its use in breeding. The aim of this study was to characterize the genetic diversity of the manioc (Manihot esculenta) Active Germplasm Bank (AGB) at Embrapa Amazonia Ocidental using microsatellite markers. We evaluated 470 accessions collected along five of the main rivers of the Amazon basin: Solimoes, Purus, Madeira, Negro, and Amazon. The ten SSR loci used showed high levels of genetic diversity, the polymorphism information content ranged from 0.35 to 0.84, and the mean number of alleles per locus was 11.3. Accessions from the Madeira River had a higher Shannon index (1.52), as well as the largest number of private alleles (19). Bayesian inference of genetic structure implemented in the Structure software suggested the existence of two groups of accessions without clear association with river basins. The accumulated variation in the first two axes of the principal coordinate analysis revealed low genetic divergence between these groups, while AMOVA identified most of the molecular variance within the groups. Farmer exchange of varieties along and among rivers probably explains the lack of structure. Although the manioc AGB of Embrapa Amazonia Ocidental contains abundant genetic diversity, no differentiation was found between the groups studied.

TI QTL Mapping for Pest and Disease Resistance in Cassava and Coincidence
   of Some QTL with Introgression Regions Derived from Manihot glaziovii
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Genetic mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), cassava mosaic disease (CMD), and cassava green mite (CGM) was performed using an F-1 cross developed between the Tanzanian landrace, Kiroba, and a breeding line, AR37-80. The population was evaluated for two consecutive years in two sites in Tanzania. A genetic linkage map was derived from 106 F1 progeny and 1,974 SNP markers and spanned 18 chromosomes covering a distance of 1,698 cM. Fifteen significant QTL were identified; two are associated with CBSD root necrosis only, and were detected on chromosomes V and XII, while seven were associated with CBSD foliar symptoms only and were detected on chromosomes IV, VI, XVII, and XVIII. QTL on chromosomes 11 and 15 were associated with both CBSD foliar and root necrosis symptoms. Two QTL were found to be associated with CMD and were detected on chromosomes XII and XIV, while two were associated with CGM and were identified on chromosomes V and X. There are large Manihot glaziovii introgression regions in Kiroba on chromosomes I, XVII, and XVIII. The introgression segments on chromosomes XVII and XVIII overlap with QTL associated with CBSD foliar symptoms. The introgression region on chromosome I is of a different haplotype to the characteristic "Amani haplotype" found in the landrace Namikonga and others, and unlike some other genotypes, Kiroba does not have a large introgression block on chromosome IV. Kiroba is closely related to a sampled Tanzanian "tree cassava." This supports the observation that some of the QTL associated with CBSD resistance in Kiroba are different to those observed in another variety, Namikonga.

TI Environmental life cycle assessment and social impacts of bioethanol
   production in Thailand
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Bioethanol is an important renewable energy for transportation fuels in Thailand due to energy security it provides and the reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Cassava and sugarcane are considered to be the most important feedstocks that produce bioethanol in Thailand due to an abundant, renewable resource in the country. This study aims to evaluate the potential environmental performance and social impacts associated with the bioethanol supply chain. The environmental impacts of bioethanol in this study were assessed by using life cycle assessment method. The impact categories consisted of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, eutrophication potential (EP), direct land use change (dLUC), and water impact potential (WIP). The social impacts, including the total employment, wages and fatal occupational injury are carried out based on the process-based and input-output analysis approaches. The results showed that the GHG emissions of the bioethanol systems are 26-39 kg CO(2)eq/GJ, which is less than conventional gasoline. In addition, the results showed that the dLUC effect on the bioethanol production increased the GHG impact by 10-73%. However, it's found that the EP and water impact caused by bioethanol production is higher than for gasoline. In regards to the social aspects, the bioethanol production has advantages in term of total employment and income generation, the job creation is 15-18 times better than gasoline and the direct income distribution in the agricultural stage accounts for 30-45% of the total income in the bioethanol supply chain. However, the fatal occupational impacts of bioethanol system are higher than for gasoline. This aspect is also discussed in the study. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Global Gene Expression Analysis Reveals Crosstalk between Response
   Mechanisms to Cold and Drought Stresses in Cassava Seedlings
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Abiotic stress negatively impacts cassava (Manihot esculenta) growth and yield. Several molecular mechanisms of plant response to cold and drought have been identified and described in the literature, however, little is known about the crosstalk of the responses of cassava to these two stresses. To elucidate this question, transcriptome analysis of cassava seedlings under cold or PEG-simulated drought stress treatment was performed. Our results showed that 6103 and 7462 transcripts were significantly regulated by cold and drought stress, respectively. Gene Ontology annotation revealed that the abscisic and jasmonic acid signaling pathways shared between the two stresses responses. We further identified 2434 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 1130 up-regulated and 841 down-regulated DEGs by the two stresses. These co-induced or co-suppressed genes are grouped as stress signal perception and transduction, transcription factors (TFs), metabolism as well as transport facilitation according to the function annotation. Furthermore, a large proportion of well characterized protein kinases, TF families and ubiquitin proteasome system related genes, such as RLKs, MAPKs, AP2/ERFBPs, WRKYs, MYBs, E2 enzymes and E3 ligases, including three complexes of interacting proteins were shown as key points of crosstalk between cold and drought stress signaling transduction pathways in a hierarchical manner. Our research provides valuable information and new insights for genetically improving the tolerance of crops to multiple abiotic stresses.

TI Multivariate optimization of simple procedure for determination of Fe
   and Mg in cassava starch employing slurry sampling and FAAS
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB A slurry sampling procedure has been developed for Fe and Mg determination in cassava starch using flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The optimization step was performed using a univariate methodology for 200 mg samples and a multivariate methodology, using the Box-Behnken design, for other variables, such as solvent (HNO3:HCl), final concentration (1.7 mol L-1) and time (26 min). This procedure allowed determination of iron and magnesium with detection limits of 1.01 and 3.36 mg kg(-1), respectively. Precision, expressed as relative standard deviation (%RSD), was of 5.8 and 4.1% (n = 10) for Fe (17.8 mg kg(-1)) and Mg (64.5 mg kg(-1)), respectively. Accuracy was confirmed by analysis of a standard reference material for wheat flour (NIST 1567a), which had certified concentrations of 14.1 +/- 0.5 mg kg(-1) for Fe and 40 +/- 2.0 mg kg(-1) for Mg, and the concentrations found using proposed method were 13.7 +/- 0.3 mg kg(-1) for Fe and 40.8 +/- 1.5 mg kg(-1) for Mg. Comparison with concentrations obtained using closed vessel microwave digestion was also realized. The concentrations obtained varied between 7.85 and 17.8 mg kg(-1) for Fe and 23.7-64.5 mg kg(-1), for Mg. The simplicity, easily, speed and satisfactory analytical characteristics indicate that the proposed analytical procedure is a good alternative for the determination of Fe and Mg in cassava starch samples.

TI Detection of unexpected frauds: Screening and quantification of maleic
   acid in cassava starch by Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy and chemometrics were adopted for the rapid analysis of a toxic additive, maleic acid (MA), which has emerged as a new extraneous adulterant in cassava starch (CS). After developing an untargeted screening method for MA detection in CS using one-class partial least squares (OCPLS), multivariate calibration models were subsequently developed using least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) to quantitatively analyze MA. As a result, the OCPLS model using the second-order derivative (D2) spectra detected 0.6% (w/w) adulterated MA in CS, with a sensitivity of 0.954 and specificity of 0.956. The root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.192 (w/w, %) by using the standard normal variate (SNV) transformation LS-SVM. In conclusion, the potential of FT-NIR spectroscopy and chemometrics was demonstrated for application in rapid screening and quantitative analysis of MA in CS, which also implies that they have other promising applications for untargeted analysis.

TI Evaluation and Selection of Potential Biomass Sources of North-East
   India towards Sustainable Bioethanol Production
SO FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
AB Vegetation biomass production in North-East India within Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot is luxuriant and available from April to October to consider their potential for bioethanol production. Potential of six lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) sources; namely, sugarcane bagasse (BG), cassava aerial parts (CS), ficus fruits (Ficus cunia) (FF), "phumdi" (floating biomass), rice straw (RS), and sawdust were investigated for bioethanol production using standard techniques. Morphological and chemical changes were evaluated by Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and quantity of sugars and inhibitors in LCB were determined by High performance liquid chromatography. Hydrothermally treated BG, CS, and FF released 954.54, 1,354.33, and 1,347.94 mg/L glucose and 779.31, 612.27, and 1,570.11 mg/L of xylose, respectively. Inhibitors produced due to effect of hydrothermal pretreatment ranged from 42.8 to 145.78 mg/L acetic acid, below detection level (BDL) to 17.7 mu g/L 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and BDL to 56.78 mu g/L furfural. The saccharification efficiency of hydrothermally treated LCB (1.35-28.64%) was significantly higher compared with their native counterparts (0.81-17.97%). Consolidated bioprocessing of the LCB using MTCC 1755 (Fusarium oxysporum) resulted in maximum ethanol concentration of 0.85 g/L and corresponded to 42 mg ethanol per gram of hydrothermally treated BG in 120 h followed by 0.83 g/L corresponding to 41.5 mg/g of untreated CS in 144 h. These ethanol concentrations corresponded to 23.43 and 21.54% of theoretical ethanol yield, respectively. LCB of CS and FF emerged as a suitable material to be subjected to test for enhanced ethanol production in future experiments through efficient fermentative microbial strains, appropriate enzyme loadings, and standardization of other fermentation parameters.

TI Will farmers intend to cultivate Provitamin A genetically modified (GM)
   cassava in Nigeria? Evidence from a k-means segmentation analysis of
   beliefs and attitudes
SO PLOS ONE
AB Analysis of market segments within a population remains critical to agricultural systems and policy processes for targeting new innovations. Patterns in attitudes and intentions toward cultivating Provitamin A GM cassava are examined through the use of a combination of behavioural theory and k-means cluster analysis method, investigating the interrelationship among various behavioural antecedents. Using a state-level sample of smallholder cassava farmers in Nigeria, this paper identifies three distinct classes of attitude and intention denoted as low opposition, medium opposition and high opposition farmers. It was estimated that only 25% of the surveyed population of farmers was highly opposed to cultivating Provitamin A GM cassava.

TI Starch-graft-poly(methyl acrylate) copolymer: the new approach to
   synthesis and copolymer characterization
SO JOURNAL OF POLYMER RESEARCH
AB The two-stage method for poly(methyl acrylate) grafting starch using triethylborane and 1,4-benzoquinone has been developed. The first stage was borylation of alcohol groups of starch. The second stage was polymerization of methyl acrylate in the inhibitor-1,4-benzoquinone-presence accompanied by the SH2-substitution at the boron atom. The advantages of developed method were the homogeneity of the process, the high yield of graft-copolymer, the possibility to control of chain length of synthetic polymer, and the absence of homopolymer in the final product. The molecular weight characteristics of starch-graft-poly(methyl acrylate) copolymer was determined by gel-permeation chromatography. The evidence of the graft-copolymer formation was 11B nuclear magnetic resonance data and its glass-transition temperature. The resulting graft-copolymer has an amphiphilic nature and a high thermal stability compared to the corresponding homopolymers (starch and poly(methyl acrylate)). According to the calculated values of the surface Gibbs energy the surface of starch-graft-poly(methyl acrylate) films is characterized as a high-energy surface.

TI Major Novel QTL for Resistance to Cassava Bacterial Blight Identified
   through a Multi-Environmental Analysis
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Cassava, Manihot esculenta Crantz, has been positioned as one of the most promising crops world-wide representing the staple security for more than one billion people mainly in poor countries. Cassava production is constantly threatened by several diseases, including cassava bacterial blight (CBB) caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis (Xam), it is the most destructive disease causing heavy yield losses. Here, we report the detection and localization on the genetic map of cassava QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) conferring resistance to CBB. An F1 mapping population of 117 full sibs was tested for resistance to two Xam strains (Xam318 and Xam681) at two locations in Colombia: La Vega, Cundinamarca and Arauca. The evaluation was conducted in rainy and dry seasons and additional tests were carried out under controlled greenhouse conditions. The phenotypic evaluation of the response to Xam revealed continuous variation. Based on composite interval mapping analysis, 5 strain-specific QTL for resistance to Xam explaining between 15.8 and 22.1% of phenotypic variance, were detected and localized on a high resolution SNP-based genetic map of cassava. Four of them show stability among the two evaluated seasons. Genotype by environment analysis detected three QTL by environment interactions and the broad sense heritability for Xam318 and Xam681 were 20 and 53%, respectively. DNA sequence analysis of the QTL intervals revealed 29 candidate defense-related genes (CDRGs), and two of them contain domains related to plant immunity proteins, such as NB-ARC-LRR and WRKY.

TI Leaf area estimation of cassava from linear dimensions
SO ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
AB The objective of this study was to determine predictor models of leaf area of cassava from linear leaf measurements. The experiment was carried out in greenhouse in the municipality of Botucatu, Sao Paulo state, Brazil. The stem cuttings with 5-7 nodes of the cultivar IAC 576-70 were planted in boxes filled with about 320 liters of soil, keeping soil moisture at field capacity, monitored by puncturing tensiometers. At 80 days after planting, 140 leaves were randomly collected from the top, middle third and base of cassava plants. We evaluated the length and width of the central lobe of leaves, number of lobes and leaf area. The measurements of leaf areas were correlated with the length and width of the central lobe and the number of lobes of the leaves, and adjusted to polynomial and multiple regression models. The linear function that used the length of the central lobe LA = -69.91114 + 15.06462L and linear multiple functions LA = -69.9188 + 15.5102L + 0.0197726K -0.0768998J or LA = -69.9346 + 15.0106L + 0.188931K 0.0264323H are suitable models to estimate leaf area of cassava cultivar IAC 576-70.

TI Durable superhydrophobic paper enabled by surface sizing of starch-based
   composite films
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Superhydrophobic paper with remarkable durability is of considerable interest for its practical applications. In this study, a scalable, inexpensive, and universal surface sizing technique was implemented to prepare superhydrophobic paper with enhanced durability. A thin layer of starch-based composite, acting as a bio-binder, was first coated onto the paper surface by a sophisticated manufacturing technique called surface sizing, immediately followed by a spray coating of hexamethyl disilazane treated silica nanoparticles (HMDS-SiNPs) dispersed in ethanol on the surface of the wet starch-coated sheet, and the dual layers dried at the same time. Consequently, durable superhydrophobic paper with bi-layer structure was obtained after air drying. The as-prepared superhydrophobic paper not only exhibited a self-cleaning behavior, but also presented an enhanced durability against scratching, bending/deformation, as well as moisture. The universal surface sizing of starch-based composites may pave the way for the up-scaled and cost-effective production of durable superhydrophobic paper. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Temporal dynamics of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) varietal
   diversity in two production basins in the Republic of the Congo
SO CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB Cassava is the staple food of the Congolese population. It is mostly grown in family farms where varietal diversity is a major factor of adaptation to changes. However, the way producers manage this diversity over time is unknown. This study characterizes the dynamics of cassava diversity in two production areas between 2007 and 2012, based on surveys of 300 households. Farms varietal diversity was characterized from field inventories based on vernacular names. Diversity levels of farms, villages and sites and composition of varietal portfolios were compared between the two years. Moreover, the qualitative comparison of these inventories with those of the 1970s made it possible to establish which varieties were cultivated in both periods. Finally, the causes of abandon and adoption of varieties reported by producers were synthesized. Diversity levels of sites and villages remained stable between 2007 and 2012, but villages' varietal portfolios have undergone major transformations and the intensity of these changes varies among them. At a longer timescale (40 years), some varieties were maintained despite changes in agricultural systems. The influence of the different processes involved in these dynamics is discussed.

TI Properties of lotus seed starch-glycerin monostearin complexes formed by
   high pressure homogenization
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB Starch-lipid complexes were prepared using lotus seed starch (LS) and glycerin monostearate (GMS) via a high pressure homogenization (HPH) process, and the effect of HPH on the physicochemical properties of LS-GMS complexes was investigated. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and complex index analysis showed that LS-GMS complexes were formed at 40 MPa by HPH and the complex index increased with the increase of homogenization pressure. Scanning electron microscopy displayed LS-GMS complexes present more nest-shape structure with increasing homogenization pressure. X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry results revealed that V-type crystalline polymorph was formed between LS and GMS, with higher homogenization pressure producing an increasingly stable complex. LS-GMS complex inhibited starch granules swelling, solubility and pasting development, which further reduced peak and breakdown viscosity. During storage, LS-GMS complexes prepared by 70-100 MPa had higher Avrami exponent values and lower recrystallization rates compared with native starch, which suggested a lower retrogradation trendency.

AB Pepper production has great commercial value for ornamental and food use. This makes it necessary to improve cultivation techniques, such as environmental control and low cost substrata. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the emergence parameters and growth of seedlings in tray, as well as plant growth and production in pots of pepper cvs. Tupa Bode Vermelha and Boyra Habanero Vermelha and ornamental pepper cultivars Etna and Piramide, in three different types of greenhouse and six types of substrata. Three greenhouses were evaluated: 1) a greenhouse with low-density transparent polyethylene film and reflective aluminized screen under the film; 2) sombrite (R) mono black filament with 50% shade; and 3) aluminet (R), reflective aluminized screen. In these environments we tested six substrata a) 1/2 cattle manure (E) and 1\2 humus (H); b) 1/2E and 1/2 vermiculite (V); c)1/2 E and 1/2 cassava's leaves (R); d) 1\3E+1\3 H+1\3 V; e)1\3E+1\3H+1\3R and f) 1\4E+1\4 H + 1\4V+1\4 R. Since no replication of cultivation was carried out, each environment was considered as one experiment. The use of substrata 1\2 E+1\2 R;1\3E+1\3H+1\3R and1\3E+1\3H+1\3V allowed greater stem diameter, plant height and Dickson quality index in seedling stage of cultivars Etna, Piramide, Tupa and Boyra. The number of fruit was higher with the use of the substrata 1/2E+1/2R and1/3E+1/3H+1/3V. The most suitable environment for pepper production is the greenhouse for all cultivars, followed by sombrite (R) (especially for cultivars Tupa and Boyra) and aluminet (R) (Piramide).

TI Use of response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize pea
   starch-chitosan novel edible film formulation
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-MYSORE
AB The aim of this study was to develop an optimal formulation for preparation of edible films from chitosan, pea starch and glycerol using response surface methodology. Three independent variables were assigned comprising chitosan (1-2%), pea starch (0.5-1.5%) and glycerol (0.5-1%) to design an empirical model best fit in physical, mechanical and barrier attributes. Impacts of independent variables on thickness, moisture content, solubility, tensile strength, elastic modulus, elongation at break and water vapor permeability of films were evaluated. All the parameters were found to have significant effects on physical and mechanical properties of film. The optimal formulation for preparation of edible film from chitosan, pea starch and glycerol was 1% chitosan, 1.5% pea starch and 0.5% glycerol. Edible films with good physical and mechanical properties can be prepared with this formulation and thus this formulation can be further applied for testing on coating for fruit and vegetables.

TI Improvement of rheological, thermal and functional properties of tapioca
   starch by using gum arabic
SO LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Gum arabic (GA) is a fairly inexpensive gum and is well known for its stabilizing, emulsifying, and thickening properties. The effects of adding GA (0.1-1.0%) on solubility, pasting, and rheological properties of 5% native tapioca starch (TS) were analyzed. Dynamic viscoelasticity measurements showed that the elastic modulus (G') and the viscous modulus (G") increased in the presence of GA, suggesting a strong interaction between GA-TS in the composite system. All concentrations of GA resulted in higher elasticity (G' > G"). Pasting properties revealed that the peak viscosity and setback of the TS-GA dispersion decreased with increasing concentration of GA, suggesting the importance of GA in controlling overall viscosity. The flow behavior index (n) decreased from 0.99 to 0.23 as the concentration of GA in the dispersion increased, indicating pseudoplastic behavior (n < 1). However, the consistency coefficient increased by 5 times, from 0.006 to 0.283 Pa.s. with increasing GA concentration (0.1-1.0), showing the synergistic effect of GA. These results show that low concentrations of GA can beneficially improve the rheological behavior of TS. In addition, GA has advantages of being low cost, clean label, and fewer calories, thus broadening the application spectra of native starches. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Effects of extrusion cooking and wheat bran substitution on the
   functional, nutritional, and rheological properties of cassava-defatted
   toasted soy composite
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB Wheat bran was substituted with cassava-defatted toasted soy composite at 0, 10, and 20% substitution levels followed by extrusion cooking and some nutritional, functional, and rheological properties of the extrudates were determined. There was a significant (p< 0.05) increase in starch digestibility of composites after extrusion cooking, but the substitution of wheat bran lowered the rate and extent of starch hydrolysis. Extrusion cooking led to a reduction in NSI and IVPD. Substitution of cassava-defatted toasted soy composite with wheat bran reduced expansion and solubility index of extrudates. Extrusion cooking also promoted fiber fragmentation with a consequent increase in soluble dietary fiber and a decrease in insoluble dietary fiber content. All the composites exhibited a shear thinning behavior and the composite with 20% wheat bran had the highest viscosity. The result indicates that substitution of starch with wheat bran together with extrusion cooking can be applied to produce products with improved nutritional and functional properties.

TI Occurrence of Regulated Mycotoxins and Other Microbial Metabolites in
   Dried Cassava Products from Nigeria
SO TOXINS
AB Dried cassava products are perceived as one of the potential sources of mycotoxin ingestion in human foods. Processing either contributes to the reduction of toxins or further exposes products to contamination by microorganisms that release metabolic toxins into the products. Thus, the prevalence of microbial metabolites in 373 processed cassava products was investigated in Nigeria. With the use of liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the constituent analysis, a few major mycotoxins (aflatoxin B-1 and G(1), fumonisin B-1 and B-2, and zearalenone) regulated in food crops by the Commission of the European Union were found at concentrations which are toxicologically acceptable in many other crops. Some bioactive compounds were detected at low concentrations in the cassava products. Therefore, the exposure of cassava consumers in Nigeria to regulated mycotoxins was estimated to be minimal. The results provide useful information regarding the probable safety of cassava products in Nigeria.

TI IMPROVING ENZYMATIC SACCHARIFICATION OF CASSAVA STEM USING PEROXIDE AND
   MICROWAVE ASSISTED PRE-TREATMENT TECHNIQUES
SO CHEMICAL INDUSTRY & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING QUARTERLY
AB The effectiveness of microwave assisted alkali (MAA) and alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) pre-treatment methods in improving the enzymatic saccharification of cassava stem was investigated. Ground cassava stems were by MAA method by varying microwave power, NaOH concentration and pre-treatment time. AHP method was performed at various H2O2 concentrations, pre-treatment temperatures and times. The results showed that reducing sugar yield was higher from MAA pretreated stem when compared with AHP pre-treatment, which demonstrated that MAA pre-treatment was effective in releasing sugars. SEM studies on the pre-treated samples revealed extensive distortion of fibres in MAA pre-treated than AHP pre-treated samples, which showed pores and cracks in the fibrous structure. Spectral studies showed the change in the chemical structure of pre-treated samples. The work revealed that the studied pre-treatment methods were effective in improving the enzymatic saccharification of cassava stem.

TI Tailoring the Properties of Thermoplastic Starch with Bamboo Powder
   and/or Hollow Glass Microspheres
SO JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE MATERIALS
AB In this study, bamboo powder and/or hollow glass microspheres were added to thermoplastic cassava starch in order to overcome its drawbacks. The composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), tensile testing, water contact angle measurement and X-ray diffractometry (XRD), in addition to their thermal properties. The mechanical strength of the composites showed a general decline with increasing bamboo powder content while the water contact angles increased up to 15% of bamboo powder content (% w/w dry starch). The addition of hollow glass microspheres provides an optimal balance between hydrophobicity and mechanical strength. The results pointed to improved properties that are expected to make thermoplastic starch more attractive and hence more competitive with synthetic polymers.

TI Screening and Optimization of Lactic Acid Production from Lactobacillus
   Strains by Using Agro Waste Residues
SO RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES
AB Lactic acid is an organic acid produced by Lactobacillus strains and being used in many industries. The present study is aimed to elucidate the ability of lactic acid production with different Lactobacillus strains using various agro waste substrates. These Lactobacillus were isolated from various dairy products. Out of 30 isolates, 15 isolates were identified as Lactobacillus strains by morphological and physiological characterization. These strains were subjected to Solid state fermentation and Submerged fermentation by utilizing the peels of Apple, Cassava, Mosambi, Orange and Pineapple. SSF with Mosambi peel showed a higher yield of lactic acid from Lactobacillus sp LAB 23. Optimum conditions such as temperature, pH, nitrogen sources, mineral salts, inoculum concentration and fermentation time were evaluated for SSF and SmF. In SSF, the optimum culture conditions for the maximum lactic acid production were temperature 37 degrees C, pH 6.5, 2.5% yeast extract as a nitrogen sources, 8% Calicum carbonate, 0.3% magnesium sulphate as mineral salts, 4 % inoculums concentration, substrate concentration 8g, 72 h for fermentation. In SmF, the optimum culture conditions for maximum lactic acid production were temperature 40 degrees C, pH7.5, 3.5% yeast extract as a nitrogen sources, 9% Calicum carbonate, 0.4% magnesium sulphate as mineral salts, 8% inoculums concentration, 10 mL substrate concentration and fermentation time 96 h. The present study suggests that the Mosambi peel is an appropriate agro waste substrates for high yield of lactic acid under optimized conditions. Thus, the Mosambi peel could be used as a good substrate in various industries.

TI Food quantity and quality of cassava affected by leguminous residues and

   humid tropics
SO BRAGANTIA
AB The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the quality and quantity of biofortified cassava root in a humid tropical environment can be modified with the application of a combination of low- and high-quality residues of leguminous tree species. The experiment was designed as a 6 x 2 factorial (a combination of 4 legume species versus 2 levels of nitrogen) with 4 replications in a randomized block design and the following treatments: Gliricidia + Acacia, Gliricidia + Leucaena, Gliricidia + Clitoria, Leucaena + Acacia, Leucaena + Clitoria, and a control without legumes. We analyzed the shoot weight, number of roots/plant, root weight, root production, proximate composition, as well as the mineral, carotenoid, and pro-vitamin A contents. Root production increased with the application of high-quality residues. The protein level influenced the carotenoid content. The allelopathic effect of exotic genera - Leucaena and Acacia -, especially when combined, can decrease the mineral content such as potassium and, therefore, reduce the accumulation of starch.

TI High-temperature ethanol production using thermotolerant yeast newly
   isolated from Greater Mekong Subregion
SO BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB The application of high-potential thermotolerant yeasts is a key factor for successful ethanol production at high temperatures. Two hundred and thirty-four yeast isolates from Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries, i.e., Thailand, The Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Vietnam were obtained. Five thermotolerant yeasts, designated Saccharomyces cerevisiae KKU-VN8, KKU-VN20, and KKU-VN27, Pichia kudriavzevii KKU-TH33 and P. kudriavzevii KKU-TH43, demonstrated high temperature and ethanol tolerance levels up to 45 degrees C and 13% (v/v), respectively. All five strains produced higher ethanol concentrations and exhibited greater productivities and yields than the industrial strain S. cerevisiae TISTR5606 during high-temperature fermentation at 40 degrees C and 43 degrees C. S. cerevisiae KKU-VN8 demonstrated the best performance for ethanol production from glucose at 37 degrees C with an ethanol concentration of 72.69g/L, a productivity of 1.59g/L/h and a theoretical ethanol yield of 86.27%. The optimal conditions for ethanol production of S. cerevisiae KKU-VN8 from sweet sorghum juice (SSJ) at 40 degrees C were achieved using the Box-Behnken experimental design (BBD). The maximal ethanol concentration obtained during fermentation was 89.32g/L, with a productivity of 2.48g/L/h and a theoretical ethanol yield of 96.32%. Thus, the newly isolated thermotolerant S. cerevisiae KKU-VN8 exhibits a great potential for commercial-scale ethanol production in the future. (C) 2017 Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.

TI Spatial dynamics and control of a crop pathogen with mixed-mode
   transmission
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
AB Trade or sharing that moves infectious planting material between farms can, for vertically-transmitted plant diseases, act as a significant force for dispersal of pathogens, particularly where the extent of material movement may be greater than that of infected vectors or inoculum. The network over which trade occurs will then effect dispersal, and is important to consider when attempting to control the disease. We consider the difference that planting material exchange can make to successful control of cassava brown streak disease, an important viral disease affecting one of Africa's staple crops. We use a mathematical model of smallholders' fields to determine the effect of informal trade on both the spread of the pathogen and its control using clean-seed systems, determining aspects that could limit the damage caused by the disease. In particular, we identify the potentially detrimental effects of markets, and the benefits of a community-based approach to disease control.

TI Effect of cassava waste on bioremediation of nitrogenous metabolites and
   shrimp growth
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Aim: Locally available cheap carbon sources, cassava waste and cassava starch, were tested for their efficiency in decreasing the nitrogenous metabolites, resulting due to accumulation of uneaten feed and excreta at the pond bottom during intensive shrimp aquaculture.
   Methodology: Yard experiment was carried out in 5001 Fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) tanks fora period of 105 days with four treatments viz., cassava waste, cassava starch, cassava waste+cassava starch and control, replicated thrice and statistically randomized with Tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon (1.71 g). The following water quality parameters - pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N); microbial parameters in water and sediment - total heterotrophic bacteria count (THBC) and total vibrio count (TVC); proximate composition, fibre fractionation, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur content in cassava waste and cassava starch were analyzed. The growth of shrimp was also studied.
   Results: Shrimp growth was significantly high (p <= 0.05) in cassava waste (11.12 g) treatment followed by cassava starch (10.4 g), cassava waste + cassava starch (9.8 g) and control (8.02 g) at the end of the experiment. Cassava waste, cassava starch and combination of both significantly decreased the concentration of metabolites and had high heterotrophic bacterial population and low total vibrio count compared to control.
   Interpretation: It was concluded that addition of cassava waste had positive effect on bioremediation of nitrogenous metabolites, enhancing the growth of shrimp.

TI Selected physicochemical properties of starches isolated from ten
   cassava varieties reveal novel industrial uses
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB Although cassava is of great importance as a starch source for industrial purposes or food consumption, the evaluation of different varieties is an under-investigated topic. Thus, in order to contribute to the identification of cassava starches more suitable for use and application in the food industry, this study aimed to analyze and compare the physicochemical properties of starches from ten different cassava varieties of household consumption, industrial use, and mixed use. In order to accomplish this goal, analyses were performed into the thermal and pasting properties, granule size, and amylopectin branch-chain-length distribution and amylose and phosphorus contents, as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the starches. In addition, a principal component analysis (PCA) biplot was generated, as one of the most useful methods to analyze multidimensional datasets with quantitative variables. Significant differences in phosphorus and amylose contents, branch-chain-length distribution of amylopectin, starch granule diameter, gelatinization and retrogradation temperatures, and pasting properties were obtained. Therefore, this study adds to the literature regarding the physicochemical properties of starches of these cassava varieties, contributing to improving their uses in the food industry by novel applications these starches, and adding and corroborating uses of some varieties studied.

TI Morphometric and crystallinity changes on jicama starch (Pachyrizus
   erosus) during gelatinization and their relation with in vitro glycemic
   index
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB The effect of gelatinization on the in vitro glycemic index (GI) of starch obtained from jicama tubers was investigated, and the relationships between the starch crystallinity, granule morphology, and the GI were measured. Samples were prepared by heating an aqueous dispersion of starch (1: 3 w/v) at different baking process temperatures (60, 65, 70, 75, or 80 degrees C). Native starch granules showed spherical and polyhedral shapes, with a morphometric aspect ratio (AR) of 0.89-1.0 and sizes ranging from 3 to 21 mu m. During the thermal process a change in the AR (0.21-0.88) and size (3.0-46 mu m) was observed, as well as the formation of agglomerates. Native jicama starch exhibited a C-A-type X-ray diffraction pattern, while those thermally treated showed a transition from the C-A-type to C-B-type, decreasing their crystallinity (20.8-11.5%) at higher temperatures. The gelatinization degree of the starch samples and the glycemic index showed the largest values (97.4% and 98.6% respectively) at the highest temperature (80 degrees C), while the crystallinity percentage followed an inverse correlation to temperature (11.5%, 80 degrees C), indicating that the thermal history affected the behavior of the starch enzymatic digestion. The in vitro glycemic index correlated positively with the gelatinization degree based on aspect ratio (R-2 = 0.977), DSC gelatinization enthalpy (R-2 = 0.969), and crystallinity (R-2 = -0.988). Based on these results a mathematical model is proposed to determine the glycemic index as a function of the aspect ratio. However, more studies are required to validate this information.

TI Comparative study of RS4 type resistant starches derived from cassava
   and potato starches via octenyl succinylation
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB Resistant starch is becoming important among functional foods because of its similarity to dietary fiber in many physiological properties. In the present study, an attempt has been made to compare two distinct tuber starches from cassava and potato, in the formation of RS4 type resistant starch by chemical modification with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA). The octenyl succinate esters of both the starches exhibited significant changes in structural, functional, and dietetic properties in comparison to their respective native counterparts. The modified starches were characterized by FTIR, SEM, and XRD analysis. The pasting, gelatinization, and in vitro digestibility properties were also determined. The water binding capacity of both the starches increased upon modification. The pasting and gelatinization properties of the two starches were affected differently. The cooked samples of octenyl succinylated potato starch showed slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS) in the range of 10.53-34.86% and 3.58-29.1%, respectively, whereas these were 20.46-38.36% and 1.47-27.92%, respectively, for cassava starch. In both cases, RS and SDS of modified starches increased significantly and glycemic index (GI) decreased in comparison to corresponding native starches.

AB Objective: This study was aimed at evaluating effects of cattle breed resources and alternative mixed-feeding practices on meat productivity and emission intensities from household farming systems (HFS) in Daklak Province, Vietnam.
   Methods: Records from Local YellowxRed Sindhi (Bos indicus; Lai Sind) and 1/2 Limousin, 1/2 Drought Master, and 1/2 Red Angus cattle during the growth (0 to 21 months) and fattening (22 to 25 months) periods were used to better understand variations on meat productivity and enteric methane emissions. Parameters were determined by the ruminant model. Four scenarios were developed: (HFS1) grazing from birth to slaughter on native grasses for approximately 10 h plus 1.5 kg dry matter/d (0.8% live weight [LW]) of a mixture of guinea grass (19%), cassava (43%) powder, cotton (23%) seed, and rice (15%) straw; (HFS2) growth period fed with elephant grass (1% of LW) plus supplementation (1.5% of LW) of rice bran (36%), maize (33%), and cassava (31%) meals; and HFS3 and HFS4 computed elephant grass, but concentrate supplementation reaching 2% and 1% of LW, respectively.
   Results: Results show that compared to HFS1, emissions (72.3 +/- 0.96 kg CH4/animal/life; least squares means +/- standard error of the mean) were 15%, 6%, and 23% lower (p<0.01) for the HFS2, HFS3, and HFS4, respectively. The predicted methane efficiencies (CO(2)eq) per kg of LW at slaughter (4.3 +/- 0.15), carcass weight (8.8 +/- 0.25 kg) and kg of edible protein (44.1 +/- 1.29) were also lower (p<0.05) in the HFS4. In particular, irrespective of the HSF, feed supply and ratio changes had a more positive impact on emission intensities when crossbred 1/2 Red Angus cattle were fed than in their crossbred counterparts.
   Conclusion: Modest improvements on feeding practices and integrated modelling frameworks may offer potential trade-offs to respond to climate change in Vietnam.

TI Sorptive properties of modified maize starch as indicators of their
   quality
SO INTERNATIONAL AGROPHYSICS
AB The physical and adsorptive properties of three products of modified maize starch in terms of the susceptibility of starch granules to surface processes as affected by their physicochemical diversity was compared in this study, using five mathematical models. It was assumed that modification of native starch is an important factor affecting its adsorptive properties. The products under study differed significantly in terms of the distribution of the size and shape parameters of their granules. The Guggenheim, Anderson and de Boer equation, characterised by relatively low sums of square deviations and low and similar errors of their different parameters, was the most useful in the description of empirically determined isotherms of adsorption. Parameters of the Guggenheim, Anderson and de Boer equation were used to estimate the parameters of the product surface microstructure. Modification of native maize starch differentiated the size of the monolayer, specific surface of sorption, and characteristics of capillaries.

TI Macroporous mullite materials prepared by novel shaping strategies based
   on starch thermogelation for thermal insulation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED CERAMIC TECHNOLOGY
AB A rigorous microstructural analysis of porous mullite materials developed using novel shaping strategies based on the starch consolidation casting, and their thermal properties in relation to the processing and starch type were accomplished in view of their use as thermal insulators. In order to characterize the size and morphology of pore, basic size and 2D shape factors, and global 3D stereological parameters were determined using microscopy techniques. Results indicated that the porosity volume, pore connectivity degree, and mean free path were the determining factors of the lowest heat transfer by conduction registered in materials prepared with cassava starch. This material is the best candidate to be used in thermal insulation.

TI Purification and characterization of cyanogenic beta-glucosidase from
   wild apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.)
SO PROCESS BIOCHEMISTRY
AB beta-Glucosidase catalyzes the sequential breakdown of cyanogenic glycosides in cyanogenic plants. The beta-glucosidase from Prunus armeniaca L. was purified to 8-fold, and 20% yield was obtained, with a specific activity of 281 U/mg protein. The enzyme showed maximum activity in 0.15 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 6, at 35 degrees C with p-nitrophenylglucopyranoside as substrate. The beta-glucosidase from wild apricot was used successfully for the saccharification of cellobiose into D-glucose. This enzyme has a V-max of 131.6 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1) protein, Km of 0.158 mM, K-cat of 144.8 s(-1), K-cat/K-m of 917.4 mM(-1) s(-1), and K-m/V-max of 0.0012 mM min mg mu mole(-1), using cellobiose as substrate. The half-life, deactivation rate coefficient, and activation energy of this beta-glucosidase were 12.76 h, 1.509 x 10(-5) s(-1), and 37.55 kJ/mol, respectively. These results showed that P. armeniaca is a potential source of beta-glucosidase, with high-affinity and catalytic capability for the saccharification of cellulosic material.

TI Toxic Elements and Microbiological Content of Food: Evidence from a Case
   Study in a Brazilian City Heavily Contaminated by Lead and Cadmium
SO JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Food security has become a major concern of the world population and this is even more prominence in polluted areas. This study aimed to evaluate microbiological and toxic elements content of local food itens from Santo Amaro, Bahia. The determination of lead, cadmium, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and total coliform were carried out in coriander, cassava, okra, chicken muscle/liver, fish muscle and eggs. The population of total coliform and E. coli were estimated by the express count method using plates EC (AOAC 991.14) and accounting of colonies by colony counter. For toxic elements determination samples were digested using HNO3 and H2O2 following EPA 200.3 using a digester block with cold fingers. The determination of lead and cadmium was performed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometery (ICP OES). The mean total coliform has ranged from < 1 to 4.5 log CFU g(-1). Coriander presented higher mean total coliform (4.5 log CFU g(-1)) and E. coli was higher than recommended levels. The range of toxic elements revealed higher concentrations of lead in chicken muscle (1.25-11.58 mg kg(-1)) and cadmium in eggs (0.45-1.06 mg kg(-1)). Finally, the risk to the inhabitants of Santo Amaro was evident and reinforces the importance of effective actions of local authorities.

TI Evaluation of the Combined Process of Coagulation/Flocculation and
   Microfiltration of Cassava Starch Wastewater: Removal Efficiency and
   Membrane Fouling
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB In this study, cassava starch wastewater was subjected to coagulation/flocculation (C/F) combined with microfiltration (MF) to improve the final quality of treated water. In the C/F tests of the effluent, the best concentration of the natural coagulant (Tanfloc POP) was determined from a statistical analysis of color removal and turbidity data. The supernatant produced in the C/F step was subjected to MF while varying the transmembrane pressure to evaluate the permeate fluxes, fouling mechanism, and permeate quality. The mathematical model that best represented the filtration process was the fouling mechanism of partial membrane pore blockage. The best experimental conditions for coagulant dosage, settling time, and MF pressure in the combined C/F-MF process were 320 mg L-1, 15 min, and 1.4 bar, respectively. The highest overall removal efficiency rates achieved were 99% color, 91% cyanide, 75% total organic carbon, and 100% turbidity, demonstrating the promising potential of the combined C/F-MF process in the treatment of cassava starch wastewater.

TI FAMES AND MICROBIAL ACTIVITIES INVOLVED IN THE SUPPRESSION OF CASSAVA
   ROOT ROT BY ORGANIC MATTER
SO REVISTA CAATINGA
AB The incorporation of organic matter has been used to manage of diseases caused by soilborne pathogen, but there is a gap in the use of coffee residues on disease supressiveness. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of organic matter sources against cassava root rot caused by F. solani CFF109. Fertilization with coffee residue (CR), cattle manure (CM), earthworm excrements (EE) and goat manure (GM) resulted in suppression of cassava root rot. The treatments of CR and CM presented higher reduction in the cassava disease severity. There were changes in the soil microbial community structure by organic matter incorporation, mainly in total fungi and Gram-negative bacteria populations. The total organic carbon and magnesium are negatively associated with disease severity. The microbial quotient, alkaline and acid phosphatase activities were positively and the biomarker a-15: 0 was negatively associated with disease severity. This study indicated that agro-industrial residues can be recycled for providing organic matter and nutrients with effect for management of plant diseases by suppressing soilborne pathogens. This is the first evidence that the industrial residue of coffee can be use in the management of cassava root rot, caused by F. solani.

TI Absolute quantification of cassava brown streak virus mRNA by real-time
   qPCR
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS
AB Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) is the most important virus disease of cassava and a major food security threat in Africa. Yearly economic losses of up to $100 million USD have been attributed to CBSD. The lack of information on plant-virus interactions has restricted progress in breeding for CBSD resistance. Virus quantification is becoming a major tool for the quick and reliable assessment of plant host resistance. Therefore, a protocol for specific absolute quantification of Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV) was developed. CBSV and UCBSV coat protein (CP) specific standard templates: CBSV (pFer2, 826 bp) and UCBSV (pUF1-R1-1, 732) respectively were generated and maintained in a TA cloning vector. These were used to construct standard curves using a TagMan OCR assay. Standard curves with acceptable amplification efficiencies (90-105%) and coefficients of determination (R-2) greater than 0.99 were obtained. Infected cassava plants were sampled from a screenhouse and the field and used to validate this assay. Results obtained by testing several screenhouse and field samples revealed consistent absolute quantification assays for different CBSV and UCBSV isolates. This study presents the first protocol for absolute quantification of CBSVs and is expected to accelerate screening for CBSD resistance and hence breeding for CBSD resistance. The use of the method presented here should improve the clarity of virus quantification data as the results obtained are not influenced by varietal, host, seasonal or environmental conditions. Screening efficiency will also be greatly improved as there is no need for the use of reference genes consequently allowing for a larger number of samples to be analyzed. This will increase experimental precision in a timely and cost effective manner. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Bio-refractory dissolved organic matter and colorants in cassava
   distillery wastewater: Characterization, coagulation treatment and
   mechanisms
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB An important portion of organic matter and colorants still remain in the biologically treated distillery wastewater, leaving the dark brown and odorous downstream with the heavy loading of chemical oxygen demand and the potential of forming disinfection byproducts. However, those bio-recalcitrant colorants have not been clearly recognized. The current study investigated the features of the biorefractory organic matter and colorants in a typical distillery effluent, cassava distillery wastewater; special attention was paid to their change and behaviors in the coagulation treatment following the bioprocesses. The wastewater analyses denoted that the fraction of high molecular weight (1-50 kDa and >50 kDa) became predominant after the anaerobic-aerobic processes. Importantly, the lignin breakdown products, melanoidins and lignin phenols were confirmed to be the leading colored components, according to the parallel factor analysis of fluorescence excitation-emission matrixes results. Compared with lignin phenols, the former two types of colorants exhibited stronger bio-refractory activity and resulted in smaller color reduction after the aerobic treatment. Neither advanced oxidation nor adsorption could perform efficiently as post-treatment for decolorization in this study. Nevertheless, high removal of color and dissolved organic matter (similar to 94.0% and similar to 78.3%, respectively) could be achieved by the FeCl3-involved coagulation under the optimal conditions. The ferric coagulant was found to preferably interact with the aromatic compounds (such as lignin derivatives) and melanoidins via either surface complexation or electric charge neutralization, or both. The findings presented herein might provide an insight into the evaluation of bio-refractory organic colorants and the Fe(III)-involved decolorization mechanisms of ethanol production wastewaters.

TI Advances in crop insect modelling methods-Towards a whole system
   approach
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB Awide range of insects affect crop production and cause considerable yield losses. Difficulties reside on the development and adaptation of adequate strategies to predict insect pests for their timely management to ensure enhanced agricultural production. Several conceptual modelling frameworks have been proposed, and the choice of an approach depends largely on the objective of the model and the availability of data. This paper presents a summary of decades of advances in insect population dynamics, phenology models, distribution and risk mapping. Existing challenges on the modelling of insects are listed; followed by innovations in the field. New approaches include artificial neural networks, cellular automata (CA) coupled with fuzzy logic (FL), fractal, multi-fractal, percolation, synchronization and individual/agent-based approaches. A concept for assessing climate change impacts and providing adaptation options for agricultural pest management independently of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission scenarios is suggested. A framework for estimating losses and optimizing yields within crop production system is proposed and a summary on modelling the economic impact of pests control is presented. The assessment shows that the majority of known insect modelling approaches are not holistic; they only concentrate on a single component of the system, i.e. the pest, rather than the whole crop production system. We suggest system thinking as a possible approach for linking crop, pest, and environmental conditions to provide a more comprehensive assessment of agricultural crop production.

TI Variability in P1 gene redefines phylogenetic relationships among
   cassava brown streak viruses
SO VIROLOGY JOURNAL
AB Background: Cassava brown streak disease is emerging as the most important viral disease of cassava in Africa, and is consequently a threat to food security. Two distinct species of the genus Ipomovirus (family Potyviridae) cause the disease: Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV). To understand the evolutionary relationships among the viruses, 64 nucleotide sequences from the variable P1 gene from major cassava producing areas of east and central-southern Africa were determined.
   Methods: We sequenced an amplicon of the P1 region of 31 isolates from Malawi and Tanzania. In addition to these, 33 previously reported sequences of virus isolates from Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi and Mozambique were added to the analysis.
   Results: Phylogenetic analyses revealed three major P1 clades of Cassava brown streak viruses (CBSVs): in addition to a clade of most CBSV and a clade containing all UCBSV, a novel, intermediate clade of CBSV isolates which has been tentatively called CBSV-Tanzania (CBSV-TZ). Virus isolates of the distinctive CBSV-TZ had nucleotide identities as low as 63.2 and 63.7% with other members of CBSV and UCBSV respectively.
   Conclusions: Grouping of P1 gene sequences indicated for distinct sub-populations of CBSV, but not UCBSV. Representatives of all three clades were found in both Tanzania and Malawi.

TI Vitamin B-1 diversity and characterization of biosynthesis genes in
   cassava
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB Vitamin B-1, which consists of the vitamers thiamin and its phosphorylated derivatives, is an essential micronutrient for all living organisms because it is required as a metabolic cofactor in several enzymatic reactions. Genetic diversity of vitamin B-1 biosynthesis and accumulation has not been investigated in major crop species other than rice and potato. We analyzed cassava germplasm for accumulation of B-1 vitamers. Vitamin B-1 content in leaves and roots of 41 cassava accessions showed significant variation between accessions. HPLC analyses of B-1 vitamers revealed distinct profiles in cassava leaves and storage roots, with nearly equal relative levels of thiamin pyrophosphate and thiamin monophosphate in leaves, but mostly thiamin pyrophosphate in storage roots. Unusually, the cassava genome has two genes encoding the 4-amino-2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate synthase, THIC (MeTHIC1 and MeTHIC2), both of which carry a riboswitch in the 3'-UTR, as well as the adenylated thiazole synthase, THI1 (MeTHI1a and MeTHI1b). The THIC and THI1 genes are expressed at very low levels in storage roots compared with the accumulation of vitamin B1, indicating only limited biosynthesis de novo therein. In leaves, vitamin B1 content is negatively correlated with THIC and THI1 expression levels, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of THIC by the riboswitch present in the 3'-UTR of the THIC mRNA and regulation of THI1 by promoter activity or alternative post-transcriptional mechanisms.

TI Nitric oxide associated protein 1 is associated with chloroplast
   perturbation and disease symptoms in Nicotiana benthamiana infected with
   South African cassava mosaic virus
SO VIRUS RESEARCH
AB Nitric oxide associated 1 (NOA1) in plants is a cyclic GTPase involved in protein translation in the chloroplast and has been indirectly linked to nitric oxide (NO) accumulation and response to biotic stress. The association between NOA1 and NO accumulation in Arabidopsis noal mutants has been linked to the inability of noal mutants to accumulate carbon reserves such as fumarate, leading to chloroplast dysfunction and a pale green leaf phenotype. To understand the role played by NOA1 in response to South African cassava mosaic virus infection in Nicotiana benthamiana, the expression of NbNOA1 and the accumulation of NO in leaf samples was compared between south african cassava mosaic (SACMV)-infected and mock-infected plants at 14 and 28 dpi. Real-time qPCR was used to measure SACMV viral load which increased significantly by 20% from 14 to 28 dpi as chlorosis and symptom severity progressed. At 14 and 28 dpi, NbNOA1 expression was significantly lower than mock inoculated plants (2-fold lower at 14 dpi, p-value = 0.01 and 5-fold lower at 28, p-value = 0.00). At 14 dpi, NO accumulation remained unchanged in infected leaf tissue compared to mock inoculated, while at 28 dpi, NO accumulation was 40% lower (p-value = 0.01). At 28 dpi, the decrease in NbNOA1 expression and NO accumulation wad accompanied by chloroplast dysfunction, evident from the significant reduction in chlorophylls a and b and carotenoids in SACMV-infected leaves. Furthermore, the expression of chloroplast translation factors (chloroplast RNA binding, chloroplast elongation factor G, translation elongation factor Tu, translation initiation factor 3-2, plastid-specific ribosomal protein 6 and plastid ribosome recycling factor) were found to be repressed in infected N. benthamiana. GC MS analysis showed a decrease in fumarate and an increase in glucose in SACMV-infected N. benthamiana in comparison to mock samples suggesting a decrease in carbon stores. Collectively,. these results provide evidence that in response to SACMV infection, a decrease in photopigments and carbon stores, accompanied by an increase in glucose and decrease in fumarate, leads to a decline in NbNOA1 expression and NO levels. This is manifested by suppressed translation factors and disruption of chloroplast function, thereby contributing to chlorotic disease symptoms.

TI Genome-wide characterization and expression analysis enables
   identification of abiotic stress-responsive MYB transcription factors in
   cassava (Manihot esculenta)
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB The myeloblastosis (MYB) transcription factor superfamily is the largest transcription factor family in plants, playing different roles during stress response. However, abiotic stress-responsive MYB transcription factors have not been systematically studied in cassava (Manihot esculenta), an important tropical tuber root crop. In this study, we used a genome-wide transcriptome analysis to predict 299 putative MeMYB genes in the cassava genome. Under drought and cold stresses, many MeMYB genes exhibited different expression patterns in cassava leaves, indicating that these genes might play a role in abiotic stress responses. We found that several stress-responsive MeMYB genes responded to abscisic acid (ABA) in cassava leaves. We characterize four MeMYBs, namely MeMYB1, MeMYB2, MeMYB4, and MeMYB9, as R2R3-MYB transcription factors. Furthermore, RNAi-driven repression of MeMYB2 resulted in drought and cold tolerance in transgenic cassava. Gene expression assays in wild-type and MeMYB2-RNAi cassava plants revealed that MeMYB2 may affect other MeMYBs as well as MeWRKYs under drought and cold stress, suggesting crosstalk between MYB and WRKY family genes under stress conditions in cassava.

TI Development of an optimization mathematical model by applying an
   integrated environmental indicator for selecting alternatives in cleaner
   production programs
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The purpose of this work is to propose an optimized mathematical model to facilitate the selection alternatives in cleaner production (CP) programs. On the basics of goal programming, this study develops an integer-programming model for CP option selection in case of multi-innovation objects and multi alternative scenarios. With the constraints given, the model defines which objects, and which alternatives can be used for innovation to obtain the optimal objective. The model is tested and proved in a cassava starch factory in Tayninh, Vietnam. Based on production accounting, innovation objects and their CP-alternatives in this factory are identified. Baseline integrated environment impact of the factory is 11,882 person equivalent (PE), in which bulk waste is 52.7%, global warming is 11.9%, photochemical ozone creation is 10.8%, energy is 10%, and the rest is 14.5%. With 135,000 USD for environmental impact reduction, the maximum reduction potentials obtained from solving the model are 8335.2 PE and 878.68 PE in case of minimization of integrated environment indicator and global warming, respectively. The results show that this model works excellently as a support alternative selection tool for CP programs. This study also develops a new cyclic methodology for CP programs based on applying the integer programming model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Cleaning cassava genotypes infected with cassava frogskin disease via in
   vitro shoot tip culture
SO GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH
AB This study aimed to develop a methodology for eliminating cassava frogskin disease (CFSD) from in vitro shoot tip culture by associating thermotherapy and tetracycline. Cuttings from different accessions (BGM0232, BGM0315, BGM0464, BGM584, BGM0841, and BGM1342), infected with CFSD according to visual inspection of the disease symptoms, were used for cleaning. To verify the absence of other diseases, the plants were indexed for Cassava common mosaic virus - CsCMV (by ELISA) and Cassava vein mosaic virus - CsVMV (by polymerase chain reaction, PCR), proving that the accessions were free of these viruses, except for BGM0315 and BGM0464, which were infected with CsVMV. Subsequently, the cuttings were submitted to different tetracycline concentrations for 3 min, and then subjected to thermotherapy under different temperatures (35 degrees, 38 degrees, 40 degrees, 45 degrees, and 55 degrees C). Shoots of 2 cm were harvested, and their surfaces were sterilized in a laminar flow chamber. Subsequently, the shoot tips of different sizes were removed (0.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 1.0 mm) for inoculation in a culture medium with tetracycline at the same concentrations in which the cuttings were dipped. After 60 days of cultivation, the explants were transferred to a multiplication medium without antibiotics. Thirty days after the transfer, the viability of the regenerated plants was evaluated, which were then acclimatized for 70 days in a greenhouse and transferred to the field. After 7 months, a visual analysis of the symptomatic roots and a PCR analysis were held to prove the elimination of CFSD and CsVMV from the accessions infected with these viruses (BGM0315 and BGM0464), respectively. Most of the treatments resulted in 100% cleaning of CFSD-infected plants. From accessions that were also infected with CsVMV, only 2% of the plants remained infected, also demonstrating the cleaning efficiency of this protocol for this disease.

This species resembles M. compositifolia because of its lianescent habit and indehiscent fruits, but differs by its simple, unlobed leaves and orbicular fruits (vs. compound, [3-] 5[-7]-foliolate leaves and ellipsoid fruits in M. compositifolia). Manihot macrocarpa occurs in areas of rain forest in southern Bahia State. It is considered endangered (EN B1) because it has an extent of occurrence smaller than 5,000 km(2) and is known from no more than five locations. A key to Manihot species with indehiscent fruits and comments about the new species are provided.

TI A novel approach for the production and purification of
   mannosylerythritol lipids (MEL) by Pseudozyma tsukubaensis using cassava
   wastewater as substrate
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB P. tsukubaensis is a yeast-like microorganism that synthesized the biosurfactant mannosylerythritol lipids-B (MEL-B). Production cost can be one of the drawbacks of biosurfactants production. Therefore the development of efficient and cost effective purification strategies and the use of by-products in the culture medium could serve as important strategies to reduce overall process cost. The aim of this work was to evaluate the production of MEL using cassava wastewater, a hydrophilic medium composed of a low-cost substrate which is a by-product of cassava processing, followed by foam fractionation and ultra filtration of MEL. Cassava wastewater proved to be a feasible culture medium for P. tsukubaensis and MELB production as the yield (1.26 g L-1) was similar to that reported by others using water-soluble carbon sources (up to 2 g L-1). Interestingly ultrafiltration with 100 kDa MWCO membranes (using 20 mL centrifugal devices) led to the purification of MEL-B in one step since approximate to 80% of MEL was recovered, while more than 95% of proteins were found in the permeate. The scale up of the ultrafiltration (up to 500 mL) using a cross flow filtration unit led to very similar results. Overall the ultrafiltration led to a threefold increase in MEL purity in terms of protein (at both scales). The chemical characterization by NMR confirmed the production of MEL-B homologue and also the production of a second stereoisomer approximate to 9%, while the CG-MS and MALDI-TOFMS analysis confirmed the main fatty acids within the structure of MEL-B (C8:0 and 12:0 and C8:0 and C14:1). Therefore, the process developed here was found to be a good alternative to the conventional production of MEL which uses synthetic culture medium, solvent extraction (ethyl acetate) and column chromatography (silica) for its purification.

AB Even though the effect of release frequency of green lacewings in controlling the spread of mealybugs in a cassava field was investigated by Promrak and Rattanakul in 2015, the effect of increased global temperature was not taken into account. In this work, cellular automata and Monte Carlo simulation are employed in order to study the effect of an increased global temperature on the life cycles of mealybugs and green lacewings which in turn effects the efficacy of the biological control of the spread of mealybugs. Computer simulations are carried out at different temperatures so that an efficient biological control of the spread of mealybugs in a cassava field is obtained.

TI Crop wild relative conservation: Wild yams are not that wild
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB Extension of land use has been the main way to increase agricultural production to date. Natural habitats have consequently decreased and became increasingly fragmented, putting high pressure on the wild relatives of main crops. In this study, we assessed the diversity of wild relatives and cultivated varieties of yam, Dioscorea rotundata, a tuber crop grown in West Africa. Using nuclear markers, we showed that 19% of the wild plants were in fact hybrids between wild and cultivated varieties. Using whole chloroplast sequences, our results suggest that hybridization may be even stronger, with 43% of the wild individuals presenting either chloroplast or nuclear introgression with the cultivated yams. Adaptation of agriculture to current new pathogen outbreaks and ongoing climatic changes will require mining the vast diversity found in crops wild relatives. However, our study suggests that wild yam diversity is already largely tainted by crop-to-wild gene flow. The need to focus on in-situ wild yam conservation is even more crucial, since today, ex-situ genebanks contain nearly no wild yam accessions.

TI Surface and nutraceutical properties of edible films made from starchy
   sources with and without added blackberry pulp
SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB The surface and nutraceutical properties have been poorly studied on edible films. The aim of this study was to investigate the surface properties and potential health effects in terms of in vitro digestibility and anti-inflammatory activity. The materials were developed from native plantain starch and pre-gelatinized plantain flour with and without added blackberry pulp using casting methodology. Thermogravimetric analysis, contact angle, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, resistant starch, in vitro digestibility, cell viability, reactive oxygen species, anti-inflammatory activity and sensory evaluation were the tests carried out in this study. Films containing blackberry pulp had more compact and smooth morphologies, which were related to the lower in vitro digestibility rate and the higher resistant starch content. In addition, these materials had higher anti-inflammatory activity, higher cell viability, and better acceptance by the panelists, thus suggesting potential health effects of consumers with special feeding regimes such as obese, diabetics and celiacs.

TI Quantitative and mechanistic analysis of impact of novel
   cassava-assisted improved processing on fluid transport phenomenon in
   humidity-temperature-stressed bio-derived films
SO EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL
AB Bio-derived films' realistic performance integrity is ascertained by their resilience in highly stressful storage conditions, a function of its ability to respond timely and manages fluid barrier appropriately. Bio-derived films' moisture and temperature sensitivity often posed mass transport challenges, thus decreasing their lifespan. Quantifying bio-derived film mass transport behaviour has been limited to mass transfer representations, which can be imperfect to understand fully mass transport phenomenon. This study reported quantitative and mechanistic analysis of fluid phase mass transport phenomenon in Simultaneous Release Recovery Cyanogenesis-produced intact bitter cassava (IBC) bio-derived films under stressful conditions. Films were tested for solvent solubility, swelling ratio, sorption and permeability to water vapour and oxygen at 10-40 degrees C and 10-95% RH. Film's structural alterations were characterised by their thermal and chemical properties. Modified-BET, Peleg, Oswin models best described sorption data. Temperature-dependence of film water vapour permeability was simulated best by Arrhenius model, while oxygen permeability was influenced highly by crystallinity and RH. Non-organic and organic film-solvent diffusion followed case II and Fickian diffusional patterns respectively. Solvents induced structural changes in IBC films with concentration-dependent diffusion. Cassava bio-derived films' integrity will depend on the host environment, thus maximum care should be ensured to minimise environment impact during applications. Nonetheless, IBC films hold potential as biomaterials for broad range product use.

TI Genetic basis for folk classification of oca (Oxalis tuberosa Molina;
   Oxalidaceae): implications for research and conservation of clonally
   propagated crops
SO GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION
AB Clonally propagated crops exhibit great diversity and are integral components of global and regional food systems. At the same time, little is known about the mechanisms that generate diversity within clonal crop species, and this diversity is increasingly threatened by economic, environmental, and social change. Research addressing the genetic basis for folk classification of clonal crops can address both of these challenges. Here, we carry out such research through a case study of the Andean tuber crop, oca (Oxalis tuberosa Molina). We employ ethnobotanical and molecular genetic methods to assess the congruence in partitioning of 216 oca accessions with respect to 26 folk taxa and with respect to 31 genetic clones. We find that the greatest number of folk taxa (11) correspond to single, unique genetic clones, but we also identify two instances of single folk taxa comprising multiple genetic clones and two instances of multiple folk taxa comprising single, shared genetic clones. We discuss the potential roles of different diversity-generating mechanisms, such as somaclonal variation and sexual reproduction, underlying these varied forms of congruence in order to inspire more directed research on this topic. We also discuss the implications of our findings on in situ and ex situ conservation work, in which practitioners often approximate crop genetic diversity by counting folk taxa. Ultimately, we argue that efforts to understand and conserve clonal crop diversity will be most effective when both folk classification and its genetic basis are considered together.

TI Proximal Remote Sensing of Herbicide and Drought Stress in Field Grown
   Colocasia and Sweet Potato Plants by Sunlight-Induced Chlorophyll
   Fluorescence Imaging
SO JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
AB Chlorophyll fluorescence is an indicator of plant photosynthetic activity and has been used to monitor the health status of vegetation. Several studies have exploited the application of red/far-red chlorophyll fluorescence ratio in detecting the impact of various types of stresses in plants. Recently, sunlight-induced chlorophyll fluorescence imaging has been used to detect and discriminate different stages of mosaic virus infection in potted cassava plants with a multi-spectral imaging system (MSIS). In this study, the MSIS is used to investigate the impact of drought and herbicide stress in field grown crop plants. Towards this control and treatment groups of colocasia and sweet potato plants were grown in laterite soil beds and the reflectance images of these crop plants were recorded up to 14-days of treatment at the Fraunhofer lines of O-2 B at 687 nm and O-2 A at 759.5 nm and the off-lines at 684 and 757.5 nm. The recorded images were analyzed using the Fraunhofer Line Discrimination technique to extract the sunlight-induced chlorophyll fluorescence component from the reflectance images of the plant leaves. As compared to the control group, the chlorophyll fluorescence image ratio (F (687)/F (760)) in the treatment groups of both the plant varieties shows an increasing trend with increase in the extent of stress. Further, the F (687)/F (760) ratio was found to correlate with the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) of leaves. The correlation coefficient (R (2)) for the relationship of F (687)/F (760) ratio with Pn were found to be 0.78, 0.79 and 0.78, respectively for the control, herbicide treated and drought treated colocasia plants, while these were 0.77, 0.86 and 0.88, respectively for sweet potato plants. The results presented show the potential of proximal remote sensing and the application F (687)/F (760) fluorescence image ratio for effective monitoring of stress-induced changes in field grown plants.

TI Cassava haplotype map highlights fixation of deleterious mutations
   during clonal propagation
SO NATURE GENETICS
AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is an important staple food crop in Africa and South America; however, ubiquitous deleterious mutations may severely decrease its fitness. To evaluate these deleterious mutations, we constructed a cassava haplotype map through deep sequencing 241 diverse accessions and identified >28 million segregating variants. We found that (i) although domestication has modified starch and ketone metabolism pathways to allow for human consumption, the concomitant bottleneck and clonal propagation have resulted in a large proportion of fixed deleterious amino acid changes, increased the number of deleterious alleles by 26%, and shifted the mutational burden toward common variants; (ii) deleterious mutations have been ineffectively purged, owing to limited recombination in the cassava genome; (iii) recent breeding efforts have maintained yield by masking the most damaging recessive mutations in the heterozygous state but have been unable to purge the mutation burden; such purging should be a key target in future cassava breeding.

TI Immunocapture PCR Detection of ToLCNDV from Plant Extract by using
   Heterologous Virus Coat Protein Antisera
SO PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
AB Immunocapture-PCR (IC-PCR) is very versatile technique that has the potential to expedite the detection of plant viruses from plant species containing various forms of PCR amplification inhibitors. In current study, IC-PCR was used for the detection of Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) from plant extracts of Nicotiana bentharniana plants inoculated with ToLCNDV. To immunocapture the ToLCNDV, two antisera raised against Tomato yellow leaf curl virus-coat protein (TYLCV-CP) and African cassava mosaic virus-coat protein (ACMV-CP) were used. However, immunocapture of ToLCNDV could only be achieved by using the TYLCV-CP antisera followed by PCR detection by using specific and degenerate primers. ToLCNDV is geographically wide spread Begomovirus (Family Geminiviridae), considered as a close relative of TYLCV, and cause severe losses for many economical important crops in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. This is the first report of the use of heterologous polyclonal antibodies (PAbs), raised against a geographically distinct begomovirus, ToLCNDV. The described results have shown to exhibit a many fold increase detection sensitivity and reproducibility hence, can be adopted for routine detection of ToLCNDV from plant extracts.

TI Waste bio-refineries for the cassava starch industry: New trends and
   review of alternatives
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The cassava starch industrial process generates very pollutant effluents that need to be treated before discharge. A series of successful experiences concerning the transformation of treatment ponds into covered lagoons have been conducted in the last years in Brazil, proving that the use of anaerobic digesters could make the worldwide cassava industry more profitable. The circular economy approach is used to add the balance of greenhouse gases, water and land use to the assessment of a set of waste-to-resource alternatives for this particular industrial process. The results point out to the convenience of upgrading the covered lagoon solution to a more complete waste bio-refinery that not only focus in electric power generation but also recovers process heat and biofertilizers as byproducts. Co-generation is very attractive for the resource recovery of this agricultural residue. It was also found that the higher efficiency that characterizes co-generation leads to the lowest level of greenhouse gases emissions.

TI Valorisation of Proteins from Rubber Tree
SO WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION
AB Purpose The objective of this study was to identify the availability, possible applications, and economic potential of proteins that are present in different parts of the rubber tree. Proteins from non-food sources can be used in e.g. animal feed or biochemicals production with no or little competition with food production, rendering them important biobased feedstock. Rubber tree is primarily grown for its latex that is used in rubber production. Indonesia has the largest rubber plantation area that is mostly owned and run by smallholder farmers. Using non-latex fractions from the rubber tree may generate additional income, and increase the economics of rubber plantations in general.
   Methods Several biomass streams from the rubber tree and subsequent latex processing were considered. Data were compiled from literature, a case study, and interviews with researchers, smallholder farmers, and managers at rubber processing plant and plantation.
   Results Latex waste streams, seeds, and leaves were considered to have the highest potential based on the amount of available proteins, and processes to isolate proteins from these streams were proposed. Isolation of specific functional properties from natural sources requires complex (and expensive) separation processes and therefore only economically feasible when specific use of the protein(s) for high value applications can be identified. Purification of many interesting proteins from latex fractions has already been described. Processing of seeds and leaves may also yield useful proteins for food, other purposes, and also still unknown high value applications.
   Conclusions A biorefinery concept can be applied to obtain multiple products from the seeds and leaves, and protein extraction can be performed with available knowledge and technology. Small scale processing can be more beneficial for the farmers, especially if the products are used locally for feed.

TI Thermoplastic Starch: A Possible Biodegradable Food Packaging Material-A
   Review
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB In the past years, research has been focused on biodegradable materials to replace petroleum based plastics for food packaging application. For this purpose, biopolymers are considered the most promising material because of their biodegradable nature and long shelf life properties like resistance to chemical or enzymatic reactions. Starch is renewable, cheap, and abundantly available biopolymer. However, the intermolecular forces and hydrogen bonds in starch resist it to be processed as a thermoplastic material. To overcome this issue, different plasticizers are used to have deformable thermoplastic material called thermoplastic starches (TPSs). A plasticizer enhances the flexibility, the process stability of starch below the degradation temperature. Plasticizer lowers the glass transition temperature (T-g). TPS is very promising among the biobased materials available for the production of biodegradable plastic. TPS have some limitations; bad mechanical properties and water sensitivity. Starch absorbs water under higher relative humidity. This work will provide an outline about the research that has been done on TPS during last 15 years as biodegradable food packaging material.
   Practical ApplicationsThe basic role of food packaging material is to make it cost effective that satisfies industry requirements and consumer desires, and provide protection from three major classes of external influences: chemical, biological, and physical, e.g., such as exposure to gases, barrier to microorganisms, or from mechanical damage, respectively. These external influences may damage the quality of the food and shelf life. For this motive, starch has become the most preferred option among the verified classes of synthetic and natural materials. Retrogradation of starch chains in presence of water make it impossible to be use as packaging material. To overcome this issue, Starch has been plasticized with water and low molecular weight additive that can interact with its backbone by hydrogen bonding to produce thermoplastic starch (TPS). The objective of this review is to summarize numerous studies related to interaction of plasticizers and starch for the production of biodegradable TPS food packaging materials.

TI Combination of amylase and transferase catalysis to improve IMO
   compositions and productivity
SO LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Isomaltooligosaccharides (IMOs) is a mixture of branched-maltooligosaccharides (MOSs), classified as a functional food ingredient with prebiotic potential. The objective of this study was to investigate alternative enzymatic methods to produce a sweetness/viscosity/degradability balance product containing soluble carbohydrate ranging from glucose, maltose, isomaltose and linear and branched MOS (IMOs), of different digestibility. The modified samples were produced using two main routes: 1. simultaneous catalysis by alpha-amylase and branching enzyme (BE) followed by alpha-transglucosidase (ABT) treatment, 2. simultaneous catalysis by alpha-amylase and BE followed by simultaneous beta-amylase and a-transglucosidase (ABbT). For both routes, 30% or 50% (w v(-1)) cassava starch were used and a commercial IMO (comIMO) preparation was used as a positive control. The 30ABbT and 50ABbT showed the highest alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages, panose and branched MOS (Degree of Polymerisation (DP) 4-7) compared to all other samples. All ABT and ABbT products showed decreased molecular weight and increased resistance to degradation by amylolytic enzymes as compared to cassava starch. The 50ABbT sample demonstrated the lowest digestion rate constant. Due to their high solubility and structural composition, containing-balanced glucose, maltose, isomaltose and linear and branched MOS (IMOs), of different digestibility, these compositions can be suitable especially in soft drink-and sport drink formulations.

TI Design, Fabrication and Drying Performance of Flash Dryer for High
   Quality Cassava Flour
SO AMA-AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION IN ASIA AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA
AB The design and fabrication of processing equipment in most developing countries are still faced with a number of problems due to lack of appropriate tools and equipment. In all the cases the resulting equipment are noisy, ineffective and with neither good finishing nor appearance. This study presents the use of software in appropriate design, drawing and fabrication of machine component parts for a flash dryer for high quality cassava flour. Drawings and 3D model of the components, sub-assemblies and complete machine assembly were produced using Computer Aided Design (CAD) and profile development software. The flash dryer was fabricated and installed at a Farm in Nigeria and tested under industrial conditions. The results showed that its fuel consumption was 13 L/h and the moisture content of the product was in the range of 5-7% from initial moisture content of 40-45% db. and for a feed rate of 702 kg/h of cassava mash. The computational results are in agreement with the experimental data. These values are much lower than the corresponding values obtained from two existing flash dryers in the farm when the same cassava mash was used. The quality of the cassava flour produced from the new flash dryer falls within the acceptable Nigerian standards for this product.

TI Climate change and crop choice in Zambia: A mathematical programming
   approach
SO NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES
AB While climate change is widely regarded as a threat to food security in southern Africa, few studies attempt to link the impacts of climate change on agriculture with the specificities of smallholder livelihoods. This paper presents a set of farm household models in Zambia built in order to assess the impacts of climate change on rural households across different agro-ecological regions and household types. The models combine several techniques, including linear programming of farm-level decision making, regression analysis to estimate crop yields for the year 2050, and stochastic simulation to incorporate an uncertain climate. The models are parameterized with household survey data and calibrated to best reflect present-day crop distributions at each site. Results indicate that, under the diverging climate change scenarios of two contrasting general circulation models (HadCM3 and CCSM), farmers will likely shift their choices of technologies and crops. Among smallholder farms, calorie production from field crops is estimated to decrease by 1.17-5.44%. Although farm households are expected to meet their consumption requirements, the probability of falling below a minimum threshold of crop calorie production rises, particularly for smallholders who face binding land constraints. Given the current choice set, autonomous on-farm adaptation will not be enough to offset the negative yield effects of climate change. Thus, larger-scale interventions are needed to provide farmers with additional adaptation options. (C) 2017 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Effects of proportion of cassava and lactic acid-treated cassava in
   rations on rumen pH and plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein in
   beef cattle
SO THAI JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of the proportion of cassava and lactic acid (LA)-treated cassava in rations on rumen fermentation parameters and plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) in beef cattle. Four, rumen cannulated, beef cattle were randomly assigned to four experimental rations in a study with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement in a 4 x 4 Latin square with a 16-day adaptation period, followed by a 5-day experimental period. During the 5 days of experimental period, the cattle were subjected to 4 experimental treatments, i.e. rations that contained either a high proportion or a low proportion (50% versus 35% dry matter) of cassava either untreated or LA treated. Results showed that clinical signs of subacute laminitis were influenced (P = 0.001) by the proportion of cassava, but not by the treatment of cassava. The cow fed the high proportion of untreated cassava tended to reduce (P = 0.058) the mean postprandial rumen pH, increased (P = 0.032) the area under the curve (AUC) of rumen pH less than 5.80 and tended (P = 0.087) to increase the time that rumen pH was lower than 5.80. However, plasma LBP concentrations did not respond consistently to the experimental rations. The outcome of the current study supports the idea that the treatment of cassava with LA reduces the risk of rumen acidosis when cattle are fed rations with a high proportion of cassava.

TI Preparation magnetic cassava residue microspheres and its application
   for Cu(II) adsorption
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB A novel adsorbent, magnetic cassava residue microspheres, was prepared by using an inverse emulsion method with cassava residue used as raw material, acrylic acid and acrylamide used as grafted monomer, and methyl methacrylate (MMA) used as dispersing agent; and characterized by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, particle size analyzer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometer. The results showed that the acrylic acid and acrylamide was successfully introduced into the adsorbent, and exhibited a good dispersion with uniform particle size distribution. The average particle size of the magnetic cassava residue microspheres was 206 nm, and the saturation magnetization is 11.9 emu/g. The dispersing agent MMA formed a thin film on the microspheres surface, resulting in good sphere shape and promoting the dispersion of microspheres. When used to remove Cu (II) from an aqueous solution, the adsorption capacity of magnetic cassava residue microspheres was remained at 110.5 mg/g after 6 times used. The adsorption process was conformed to a Frundlich isotherm and a pseudo-second-kinetic-order model, which was spontaneous and endothermic in nature.

TI GENOTYPE X ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION AND STABILITY ANALYSIS OF CASSAVA
   GENOTYPES AT DIFFERENT HARVEST TIMES
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES
AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) like most other crops responds to the effect of genotype by environment interaction (GEI), which makes it difficult to identify the superior genotypes in terms of performance, stability and adaptability. Currently there is limited information about the adaptability of cassava genotypes at different times of harvesting (TOH). Due to increasing demand for early storage root bulking varieties, and confounding effects of site, crop age, and season during selection, there is a need for the objective characterization of genotypes in terms of adaptability and stability with respect to TOH. The study was, therefore, conducted to identify high yielding, stable and adaptable cassava genotypes at different times of harvesting (6, 9 and 12 months after planting, MAP) through the application of multivariate analysis techniques. The study was conducted in four environments using sixteen genotypes using a triple lattice design. Variance components for individual environment were analysed using Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) while combined analysis was performed using Additive Main effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) model. The AMMI analysis of variance at three TOH revealed that variances due to genotypes, environments, and GEI were significant for most of the traits. However, at 6 MAP, GEI was not significant for most of the traits. Significance of main effects indicated stability of some genotypes across environments while GEI significance indicated that some genotypes were specifically adapted to certain environments. The non-significance of GEI at 6 MAP for almost all traits means that genotypes can be reliably evaluated in any single environment. Selection of a) high yielding genotypes based on mean performance, b) stable genotypes based on GSI (mean performance and ASV) and c) adaptability of genotypes based IPCA1 versus IPCA2 identified five genotypes (Mulola, Phoso, Maunjili, Beatrice and Unknown) that exhibited consistent performance, stability and adaptability across the three harvest periods. These genotypes are therefore best candidates for production in any of the studied and other similar environments.

TI Energy metabolizability of mixed flour containing fish silage for
   broiler chicken
SO ARQUIVO BRASILEIRO DE MEDICINA VETERINARIA E ZOOTECNIA
AB The objective of this study was to determine the nutritional value and the values of Apparent Metabolizable Energy (AME) and AME corrected for nitrogen balance (AMEn) of four mixed meals containing fish silage for slow growth type broiler chickens at 28-38 days of age. The physicochemical composition of the silage was analyzed and then a metabolism trial was performed using total excreta collection method with 180 male chicks of Red French Pesadao lineage distributed in a completely randomized design with five treatments and six replicates of six birds per experimental unit. Treatments consisted of a basal diet (RR) and four test diets containing 70% (RR), with the inclusion of 30% of mixed flour containing fish silage produced with mesquite meal (SFA) with flour of cassava meal (SFVM), with corn meal (SFM), and dehydrated cassava peel (SCM). The values for physico-chemical composition of the SFA, SFVM, SFM, SCM, were 20,63, 20.76, 21.99, and 14.54% of crude protein; 17.04, 23.22, 21.97 and 20.27% of ethereal extract; 7.53, 7.79, 8.65, and 8.83% of mineral matter; 23,07, 10,55, 16,81, and 12,34% of crude fiber; 1.79, 2.30, 1.57, and 2.72% of calcium; 1.12, 1.72, 1.45, and 1.94% of phosphorus; 532, 528, 598, and 508 of density, g/L; 4.5, 4.0, 4.4, and 4.4 of pH. As for AME and AMEn of the flours containing fish silage on dry matter basis, values were of, respectively, 3560 kcal/kg and 3402 kcal/kg for the SFA, 3574 kcal/kg and 3415 kcal/kg for SFVM, 3570 kcal/kg and 3412 kcal/kg for SFVM, and 3571 kcal/kg and 3413 kcal/kg for SCM, with the SFA showing lowest value. Based on the results, silage containing fish waste can be used in diets for broilers.

TI Maize Supply Response in Vietnam
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB This study used a supply response model to determine factors affecting maize supply in Vietnam. It estimated response coefficients from semi-annual time-series data for the period 1986-2011. Using three criteria, it chose the rational expectation hypothesis supply response model (Model I) with the separated price expectation formation hypothesis according to the information set at time (t-1) to estimate the supply response model for maize. Farmers used the available information set to form their expected price. Estimated parameters' results in Model I indicate that the farmers' supply had a positive response to the expected price of maize, but was negative to that of cassava. This means that maize and cassava are close substitutes in the supply response models. Maize production also positively responds to the amount of fertilizer per hectare, maize area, one-period lagged investment, irrigation, trend variable, and agricultural extension policy.
   Recommended policies include: enhancement of the judicious use of fertilizers and possible establishment of local factories; increase in maize area by changing the crop structure and multiple cropping with long-term industrial trees like perennials and fruit trees; improvement of the irrigation system in two deltas and in high production regions; increase in government support to farmers; increase in government spending on research and development of new maize varieties; and improvement of the extension system to provide farmers the needed market and technological information.

TI Comparative effects of corn-based diet and phase-fed cassava-based diet
   on growth rate, carcass characteristics and lipid profile of meat-type
   ducks
SO ASIAN-AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES
AB Objective: This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of a corn-or cassava-based diet on the production of meat-type ducks.
   Methods: Four hundred day-old ducks were used in this experiment. They were divided into five groups with each group replicated eight times. The ducks fed the corn-based diets served as the control group. The four other groups comprised different treatments, with each one given the cassava-based diet based on phase-feeding. Three treatments were fed the cassava-based diet from 16, 28, and 35 d; respectively up to 42 d of age and the other group was fed the cassava-based diet from 1 to 42 d of age.
   Results: The results indicated that ducks on either the corn-or cassava-based diets were similar in growth during 1 to 9 d of age. However, toward 35 to 42 d, the cassava-diet produced a higher weight gain (p<0.05). The cassava-based diet was better than the corn-based diet at increasing the outer and inner breast weights at 28, 35, or 42 d (p<0.05). In contrast, the corn-based diet was better at increasing abdominal fat (p<0.05). The two diets did not differ in their effects on the serum triglyceride, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and liver cholesterol. The corn-based diet, however, caused a highly significantly greater level of liver triglyceride (p<0.01).
   Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that both the cassava-and corn-based diets are similar in their effect on meat-type ducks during the starter stage but toward the finisher stage, the cassava-based diet has a better influence on weight gain and carcass characteristics.

TI Effects of exposure to pulsed light on molecular aspects of edible films
   made from cassava and taro starch
SO INNOVATIVE FOOD SCIENCE & EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
AB Pulsed light (PL) has been proposed as a method for modifying the physico-chemical properties of edible films by photo-polymerization. Films made from cassava or taro starch plasticized with glycerol were developed and divided into two groups. Films in group 1 were exposed to the maximum PL intensity permitted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (12 J/cm(2)), while those in group 2 acted as the controls. The thickness, opacity, density, water solubility, water activity, stability in acidic or alkaline solutions, thermogravimetric (TGA) curves, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), infrared spectra (ATR-FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) and morphology of the films were then evaluated. Edible films prepared from taro starch (lower amylose content) exposed to PL were physically modified through photo-polymerization (cross-linking), resulting in a slight improvement in starch-glycerol interactions. Conversely, starch cross-linking was not evident in the films made from the cassava starch (higher amylose content), and a photo-degradation effect (deterioration) was confirmed. Industrial relevance: This study confirmed that pulsed light (PL) caused the deterioration of edible films made from a starch with a high amylose content. In contrast, PL treatment improved the physico-chemical properties of films made from a starch with a low amylose content. PL can thus be proposed as a quick physical method for the modification of edible films on an industrial scale.

TI Effect of Climatic and Non-Climatic Factors on Cassava Yields in Togo:
   Agricultural Policy Implications
SO CLIMATE
AB This paper examines the effects of climatic and non-climatic factors on cassava yields in Togo using an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) modelling approach and pairwise Granger Causality tests. Secondary data on production statistics, rural population, climate variables, prices and nominal exchange rate for the period 1978-2009 are used. Results for estimated short- and long-run models indicate that cassava yield is affected by both normal' climate variables and within-season rainfall variability. An inverse relationship is found between area harvested and yield of cassava, but a significant positive and elastic effect of labour availability on yield in the long run. Increasing within-lean-season rainfall variability and high lean-season mean temperature are detrimental to cassava yields, while increasing main-season rainfall and mean-temperature enhance cassava yields. Through Granger Causality tests, a bilateral causality is found between area harvested and yield of cassava, and four unidirectional causalities from labour availability, real producer price ratio between yam and cassava, main-season rainfall and lean-season mean temperature to cassava yields. Based on the findings from this study, investment in low-cost irrigation facilities and water harvesting is recommended to enhance the practice of supplemental irrigation. Research efforts should as well be made to breed for drought, heat and flood tolerance in cassava. In addition, coupling area expansion with increasing availability of labour is advised, through the implementation of measures to minimize rural-urban migration.

TI Innovative and beneficial informal sweetpotato seed private enterprise
   in northern Uganda
SO FOOD SECURITY
AB Research conducted in the informal sweetpotato seed (vines) supply system in the Gulu region, northern Uganda (2013-2015) revealed a diverse set of actors using private enterprise in a range of selling and marketing channels. The different channels offer an efficient and effective marketing system, providing different services and conveniences for farmers at different prices. The actors include local vine multipliers, traders, dry season root farmers, transporters and town sellers. The local multipliers and dry season root farmers grow crops during the dry season in swampy areas and sell the vines in the following rainy season to the many farmers who lack access to such areas and therefore lack vines to plant. The presentation and discussion of this case study adds to an expanding argument in the literature for increased attention to support actors in informal food crop sectors who are providing sustainable production and marketing systems on a platform of beneficial and innovative private enterprise. Through their commercial operations, vine multipliers and other actors can effectively meet the demand of customers and at the right time and place. With suitable dissemination programmes installed, these actors could also offer access to new varieties otherwise unavailable to the majority of farmers.

TI The industrial applications of cassava: current status, opportunities
   and prospects
SO JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a drought-tolerant, staple food crop that is grown in tropical and subtropical areas. As an important raw material, cassava is a valuable food source in developing countries and is also extensively employed for producing starch, bioethanol and other bio-based products (e.g. feed, medicine, cosmetics and biopolymers). These cassava-based industries also generate large quantities of wastes/residues rich in organic matter and suspended solids, providing great potential for conversion into value-added products through biorefinery. However, the community of cassava researchers is relatively small and there is very limited information on cassava. Therefore this review summarizes current knowledge on the system biology, economic value, nutritional quality and industrial applications of cassava and its wastes in an attempt to accelerate understanding of the basic biology of cassava. The review also discusses future perspectives with respect to integrating and utilizing cassava information resources for increasing the economic and environmental sustainability of cassava industries.

In this study, thermal hydroxyl radicals in the biomimetic system performed in high-lignin cassava stillage residues did not reduce total lignin level but altered the lignin monostructure. The major beta-0-4' remained conserved, whereas. hydroxylation and modification of selective intermonomer side-chain linkages occurred in the treated lignin. The treatment can enhance enzymatic saccharification with cellulose conversion of cassava stillage residues at 97%, twice higher than that of the control. In addition, the modified lignin exhibited low invalid adsorption capacity into commercial cellulases, thereby improving the performance of cellulosic feedstock. Modifying the lignin structure, instead of removing lignin, provides new insights for development of novel treatments for high lignin biomass.

TI Interactions Between Cassava Mosaic Geminiviruses and Their Vector,
   Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae)
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
AB The sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) is the vector of the cassava mosaic geminiviruses (CMGs) that cause cassava mosaic disease (CMD). Synergistic interactions between B. tabaci and CMGs have been hypothesized as a cause of whitefly "super-abundance," which has been a key factor behind the spread of the severe CMD pandemic through East and Central Africa. The current study investigated this hypothesis by conducting experiments with CMD-susceptible cassava varieties infected with different CMGs in both the north-western Lake Zone region (pandemic affected) and the eastern Coast Zone where CMD is less severe. Male and female pairs of B. tabaci were placed in clip cages for 48h on plants of three cassava varieties at each of the two locations. There were significantly more eggs laid on CMG-infected than on CMG-free plants in the Lake Zone, whereas in Coast Zone, there were no significant differences. There were no significant differences in proportions, mortality, and development duration of immature stages of B. tabaci among virus states and cassava variety in the two locations. The overall number of eggs was significantly higher with longer development duration of the immature stages in the Lake than in the Coast Zone, whereas mortality was significantly higher in the Coast than in the Lake Zone. Based on these results, it is concluded that there was no net positive synergistic interaction between CMGs and B. tabaci for either lowland coastal or mid-altitude inland populations. Consequently, other factors seemmore likely to be the cause of the "super-abundance," and require further investigation.

TI Some Nutritional Characteristics of Enzymatically Resistant Maltodextrin
   from Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) Starch
SO PLANT FOODS FOR HUMAN NUTRITION
AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) native starch was treated with pyroconversion and enzymatic hydrolysis to produce a pyrodextrin and an enzyme-resistant maltodextrin. Some nutritional characteristics were quantified for both compounds. Pyroconversion was done using a 160:1 (p/v) starch:HCl ratio, 90 A degrees C temperature and 3 h reaction time. The resulting pyrodextrin contained 46.21% indigestible starch and 78.86% dietary fiber. Thermostable alpha-amylase (0.01%) was used to hydrolyze the pyrodextrin at 95 A degrees C for 5 min. The resulting resistant maltodextrin contained 24.45% dextrose equivalents, 56.06% indigestible starch and 86.62% dietary fiber. Compared to the cassava native starch, the pyrodextrin exhibited 56% solubility at room temperature and the resistant maltodextrin 100%. The glycemic index value for the resistant maltodextrin was 59% in healthy persons. Its high indigestible starch and dietary fiber contents, as well as its complete solubility, make the resistant maltodextrin a promising ingredient for raising dietary fiber content in a wide range of foods, especially in drinks, dairy products, creams and soups.

TI Characterization of combined organic-inorganic acid-pretreated cassava
   stem
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A number of previous studies established that the autoclave-mediated pretreatment enabled the efficient way of producing fermentable sugars from lignocellulosic residues. Hence, our emphasis was on studying the surface morphology of cassava stem to reveal its complex internal structure. In this study, combined organic (oxalic)-inorganic (sulfuric) acid was utilized for the pretreatment of cassava stem at 121 degrees C and 1 bar of pressure for 15 min. For the pretreatment, mixture containing 10 mL of 1% (w/v) of oxalic acid and 1% (w/v) sulfuric acid (5 mL each) was added to 1 g cassava stem and autoclaved. Pretreated samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ultraviolet spectroscopy (UVS). FTIR spectral studies confirmed the removal of hemicellulose and lignin from the pretreated cassava stem (PCS) when compared with untreated cassava stem. SEM micrographs revealed the decimation in the surface of cassava stem after pretreatment. XRD motifs shown that crystallinity index of PCS decreased from 63 to 52%. Thus, this study established the structural modifications to unlock its valuable components for further applications.

TI Effects of an induced molt using cassava meal on body weight loss, blood
   physiology, ovarian regression, and postmolt egg production in
   late-phase laying hens
SO POULTRY SCIENCE
AB This study was conducted to determine the effect of an induced molt using cassava meal on body weight, blood physiology, ovary, and postmolt performance in late-phase (74 wk old) H&N Brown laying hens. Hens were randomly assigned to 3 treatments of 90 birds each: 1) Controls withno induced molt (CONT); 2) molted by full feeding with cassava meal for 3 wk (FP3); and 3) molted by full feeding with cassava meal for 4 wk (FP4). Groups 2 and 3 were fed a pullet developer diet for 3 wk following treatment. During the molt period, the birds were exposed to an 8L:16D photoperiod and had access to drinking water at all times. Thereafter, all hens were fed a layer diet (17%CP), and exposed to a 16L:8D photoperiod, and production performance was measured for 16 wk. The molt treatments resulted in total cessation of egg production within 2 wk following feeding the molt diet. BW loss of birds in the FP4 treatment was approximately 30.13%, which was significantly higher than those in the FP3 treatment (25.23%). At the termination of feeding the molt diet, an increase in hematocrit values was observed for the FP3 and FP4 treatments compared to the CONT treatment. Conversely, lower values of serum estradiol, progesterone, ionized Ca and phosphorus concentrations were found for the 2 molted treatments. Ovary weight, number of follicles, and oviduct weight and length of the FP3 and FP4 treatments were diminished as compared to the CONT treatment. No consistent differences were observed between the molted treatments. Significant (P < 0.05) improvements in postmolt feed efficiency, egg production, Haugh units, shell weight, shell thickness, shell breaking strength, and mortality rate were observed for the FP4 treatment. An improvement in those performances, except for feed efficiency and egg production, was also found for the FP3 treatment. It was concluded that feeding the cassava molt diet for 4 wk could induce molt in laying hens effectively, and produce optimum postmolt productive performance.

TI Fermentation and crystallization of succinic acid from Actinobacillus
   succinogenes ATCC55618 using fresh cassava root as the main substrate
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB The fermentation of succinic acid from fresh cassava root using Actinobacillus succinogenes ATCC55618, and the recovery of the product using crystallization were investigated. Fresh cassava root is an ideal succinic acid feedstock due to its low price and high starch content. Saccharification was carried out using commercially available enzymes and diammonium phosphate was used as an inexpensive nitrogen source. Different fermentation modes were compared in terms of product yield and productivity. Results for fed-batch fermentations showed that a succinic acid titer of 151.44 g/L, with yield and productivity of 1.51 g(SA)/g(glucose) and 3.22 g/L/h could be obtained. Seeded batch cooling crystallization was investigated after pre-treatment using nanofiltration. A succinic acid crystal purity of 99.35% with a relative crystallinity of 96.77% was obtained from high seeding experiments. These results indicated that fresh cassava roots could be an economically alternative feedstock for a high quality succinic acid production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Factors influencing the food transition in riverine communities in the
   Brazilian Amazon
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB The objective of this study was to determine the main patterns and factors influencing food transition in riverine people in the Brazilian Amazon. Through interviews with a semi-structured questionnaire, we inferred their food habits and provide information about general demographic, socioeconomic, resource use and environmental context. Data from the questionnaires were categorized and analyzed using a logistic regression model to assess the relative influence of socioeconomic and environment factors on the local diet. Based on a logistic regression data analysis, it was found a greater consumption of processed food significantly associated with multiple factors such as market participation, sex (female and male), government aid to forest conservation and environment context (upland and wetland). Although the local diet is composed mainly of local resources such as fish and cassava flour, increasing incomes due to direct government subsidy programs and marketing of cassava flour have influenced these local practices and habits. Through the analysis of factors influencing food transition, it was possible to evaluate those having the greatest effect on this Amazon region and propose an alternative method to subsidy food policy grounded in local opinion surveys.

TI Expression of sucrose metabolism and transport genes in cassava petiole
   abscission zones in response to water stress
SO BIOLOGIA PLANTARUM
AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is an important crop, and its starch formation is regulated by sucrose metabolism and transport. To understand the roles of sucrose metabolism and transport in cassava under water stress, we studied not only sucrose metabolism and transport in cassava abscission zones (AZs) but also expression of respective genes. Sucrose was transported from leaves to roots in the early stage of water stress, and a reverse sucrose flow was detected in the later stages of the stress. The decrease in sucrose content was related to leaf senescence and inhibition of photosynthesis. Microarray analyses showed seven genes encoding sucrose synthase, nine genes encoding sucrose transporters, and eight genes encoding invertase in the cassava AZs under the water stress. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR confirmed two sucrose synthase and two invertase genes significantly upregulated under the stress, whereas one sucrose transporter gene was downregulated. The sucrose synthase and invertase gene expressions were negatively correlated with sucrose content under water stress, whereas sucrose transporter gene expressions were positively correlated with sucrose content.

TI Optimization of Biodegradable Foam Composites from Cassava Starch, Oil
   Palm Fiber, Chitosan and Palm Oil Using Taguchi Method and Grey
   Relational Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF POLYMERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB The objective of this work was to investigate properties of biodegradable foam manufactured from cassava starch containing the combination of additives. The mix proportions of starch foam composites were designed using Taguchi method. L16 orthogonal array with three factors i.e. oil palm fiber content, chitosan content and palm oil content at four-levels each was chosen for optimization. Based on the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio results, oil palm fiber and palm oil enhanced the flexural strength and water resistance of starch foam composites. Addition of chitosan reduced the density and increased the flexibility of samples. The analysis of variance of results indicated that chitosan was the major parameter influencing density, flexural strength and water absorption index. The oil palm fiber and palm oil were main parameters affecting water solubility index. The multi-linear regression models were developed to predict the properties of starch foam composites. The best mix proportion of starch foam composite was obtained from Grey relational analysis. The starch foam composite could be used as an alternative packaging for dry material.

TI Cassava wastewater as organic fertilizer in 'Marandu' grass pasture
SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
AB This study aimed to evaluate the use of wastewater from the cassava processing as organic fertilizer on pastures of Brachiaria brizantha cv. 'Marandu'. The treatments were wastewater doses (0, 15, 30, 60 and 120 m(3) ha(-1)), in a randomized block design with four replicates. The structural characteristics and morphological composition of the pastures were evaluated, from July 2013 to January 2014. The addition of wastewater promoted a positive linear increase in the three cuts for the canopy height, light interception and leaf area index. The maximum dry matter (DM) production was obtained with 120 m(3) ha(-1) of wastewater (2796 kg ha(-1) of DM in the second cut). The mass of senescent material in the second and third cuts fitted to positive linear equation. The increase in wastewater doses promoted the reduction of undesirable plants. The recommended dose of residual water in pastures of 'Marandu' grass is 120 m(3) ha(-1), which promotes a higher mass of forage and lower of undesirable plants.

TI Assessment of the potential industrial applications of commercial dried
   cassava products in Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD MEASUREMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION
AB Variations in the functional and pasting properties of four groups of commercial dried cassava product in Nigeria were evaluated in this study, to explore their potential for use as industrial raw materials. In total, 692 products were analyzed using standard analytical methods. The functional and pasting properties of the samples were found to vary significantly (p < 0.05). Toasted cassava was found to have the highest water absorption capacity, at 467.42 %, and dried cassava the lowest, at 252.57 %. Conversely, dried cassava was found to have the highest peak and breakdown viscosities, and toasted cassava the lowest. A significant (p < 0.01) positive correlation was found to exist between dispersibility and the swelling power (r = -0.93) and solubility index (r = -0.84) of the cassava products. Meanwhile, the correlation between dispersibility and the peak (r = -0.75) and breakdown (r = -0.72) viscosities was positive and significant (p < 0.05). Therefore, the authors of this study conclude that user industries such as the food, paper, adhesives, textiles and plywood sectors might require information on the pre-processing of cassava-based feedstock, so as to predetermine the technical usability of such raw materials within their industrial processes.

TI Quality attributes of cassava-fish crackers enriched with different
   flours: An optimization study by a simplex centroid mixture design
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB A simplex centroid mixture design (SCMD) was used to optimize ingredient combination comprising cassava starch (CS), high quality cassava flour (HQCF) and fish flour (FF) in the production of cassava-fish crackers. The standard slurry method was used and the effect of ingredient combination on some quality attributes of the crackers fried at 180 degrees C5 degrees C for 15 s was investigated. Ingredient combination has a significant positive effect on oil and moisture contents, texture but expanded less. Increase in CS and FF resulted in decrease oil uptake while it increases with HQCF. Lightness decreased with increase in FF while redness and yellowness increases. Regression analyses indicated that the quadratic, cubic as well as special cubic nonlinear terms were significant (p<0.05) in many of the models derived. Optimum ingredient mixture resulting in lower oil content and breaking force with maximum expansion and desirable physico-chemical properties was 85% CS, 10%HQCF and 5% FF.
   Practical applicationsThis work provides valuable information on deep fat frying of cassava-fish crackers using different levels of CS, HQCF and FF which are appreciated in many countries due to its pleasant sensory characteristics. The technique used is cost effective and produces fried cassava-fish crackers of relatively good quality. This study could be used by small and medium scale food processors that are interested in producing cassava-fish crackers of good quality due to availability of relatively cheap ingredients. The understanding of the influence of ingredient combinations on quality parameters is useful for deciding the appropriate level of each for an acceptable product. Predictive models generated can also be a viable tool for predicting product attributes as a function of the independent variables as well as designing of the frying process.

TI Design, construction, and performance evaluation of a gari roaster
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB Traditional roasting of cassava mash into gari continues to be an arduous and intricate unit operation for processors. It is highly labor intensive, tedious, unhygienic, and productivity is often too low to justify labor and investment time. The aim of this study was thus to design and fabricate a gari roaster and evaluate its performance. Cassava mash of different moisture contents (36.21, 39.44, and 43.27%) were roasted at different garifying temperatures (75, 85, and 95 degrees C) and performance characteristics including, roasting time, percentage material loss, functional efficiency, throughput, and machine capacity were evaluated. Results obtained indicated that roasting cassava mash of 39.44% at 85 degrees C yielded the best roasting conditions, as it had the least material loss of 7.8%, best throughput capacity and functional efficiency of 34.66 kg/hr and 92.20%, respectively. The fabricated gari roaster does not require skilled labor and can effectively address the challenges associated with gari roasting.
   Practical ApplicationThe fabricated roaster is relevant to the roasting of cassava mash to produce gari. This will practically address the impending challenges associated with gari roasting especially in the rural areas. This roaster will further ensure production of quality gari to its teeming consumers, thereby contributing to food security.

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that the 0-C stretching band was double-peaked. X-ray diffractogram manifested mostly `A' type crystalline structures, similar to that of arrowroot and corn starches. The NMR spectrum of this starch also resembled closely that of corn starch, with typical resonances at 100, 71-78 and 60 ppm. The moisture sorption isotherms of C angustifolia starch were sigmoidal shape, with cross over at higher temperature. The glass transition temperature (T-g) decreased linearly from 70.15 degrees C at 3% moisture content to 64.65 degrees C at 12% (R-2 = 0.985) while the peak gelatinization temperature of starch was 78.2 degrees C, with an enthalpy of 20.43 J/g. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that 76% of mass loss related to depolymerization of starch occurred between 275 and 345 degrees C. The derivative curve was single-peaked. Pasting studies showed that C. angustifolia starch showed peak, breakdown and setback viscosities much higher than those of cassava and arrowroot starches. The high phosphorous content conferred high paste viscosity and improved gel strength during pasting. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Optimisation of edible chitosan coatings formulations incorporating
   Myrcia ovata Cambessedes essential oil with antimicrobial potential
   against foodborne bacteria and natural microflora of mangaba fruits
SO LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Various edible coating formulations were prepared from cassava starch, chitosan and Myrcia ovata Cambessedes essential oils (MYRO-174 or -175) according to a 2(3) experimental design including six factorial points and three central points. The antimicrobial activity of the coatings was evaluated against eight foodborne bacteria using the disc diffusion method. The coatings containing MYRO-175 essential oil were the most effective. Mathematical models describing Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis and Serratia marcescens inhibition were developed using response surface methodology. The edible coatings containing 0.5% cassava starch-0.5% chitosan-1.25% MYRO-174 or -175 essential oil were applied to mangabas and their microbiological quality was evaluated during storage at 10 degrees C for 12 days. The total aerobic mesophilic bacteria, mould and yeast counts were reduced by 3 log from day 4-12. For coated mangabas inoculated with B. cereus, the counts were <1.0 log from day 2-12 of storage. These innovative coatings show potential for controlling foodborne bacteria and natural microorganism growth during the storage of fruit, particularly, mangabas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Study of preparation, composition and moisture sorption isotherm of
   Amazon River shrimp meal
SO LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Amazon River shrimp plays an important role in artisanal fishing in Brazil's Northern region, is common to observe its disposal in commercial fishing over higher economic value fish (bycatch), which is source of environmental drawbacks. The Amazon River shrimp processing is important to extend and add value to a high nutritional product. The shrimp meal production is an alternative to the processing. This work presents a shrimp meal preparation, physicochemical composition, as well as its technological functional properties, sorption isotherm and sensory analysis of a mix of cassava flour (93 g/100 g) and shrimp meal (7 g/100 g). The results showed high content in protein (67.55 g/100 g), besides palmitic fatty acids - 16:0, 13.58 g/100 g; stearic - 18:0, 5.42 g/100 g; oleic - 18:1n-9 16.20 g/100 g and docosenoic - 22:1, 13.12 g/100 g of total fatty acid in the shrimp meal composition. An extruded product was obtained (7 g/100 g of shrimp meal/93 g/100 g of cassava flour) with 78% of acceptance in sensory analysis. The Amazon River shrimp meal is potentially nutritional and it can add up value to nutritionally poorer food. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Synthesis and swelling property of the starch-based macroporous
   superabsorbent
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB The starch-based macroporous superabsorbent polymer (St-MP SAP) was synthesized by graft copolymerization of acrylic acid (AA)/2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS) onto cassava starch through free radical polymerization method by using sodium bicarbonate (SHC) as porogen. The monomer conversion kinetics was investigated to determine the suitable time of adding SHC so as to produce large numbers of stable and uniform pores inside the SAP. Introduction of SHC led to the formation of increasing pores and loose structure in St-MP SAP, the decrease of shear storage modulus (G(t)). With increasing SHC content, the size of the macro pores increased and the wall thickness decreased, and a large number of micropores can be observed on the pore walls. Meanwhile the equilibrium swelling ratio of St-MP SAP first increased and then decreased, and reached maximum as high as 1878 g/g and 119 g/g in distilled water and NaCl aqueous solution respectively for the sample with presence of 0.8 wt % SHC. Furthermore, the swelling rate constant (k) increased monotonously and fast swelling was presented. The macro and micropore structure in St-MP SAP enabled water to flow by capillary effect with much fewer obstructions, and the specific surface area increased, with the result that more hydrophilic groups can get in touch with water molecules rapidly. By introduction of SHC, the water molecules which can form hydrogen bonds with St-MP SAP molecules decreased, resulting in the decrease of the binding capacity of water molecules and water retention property.

TI Synthesis of carboxymethylcellulose/starch superabsorbent hydrogels by
   gamma-irradiation
SO CHEMISTRY CENTRAL JOURNAL
AB Background: Superabsorbent hydrogels show a large potential in a wide array of applications due to their unique properties. Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) is a commercially available water-soluble cellulose derivative of major interest in the hydrogel synthesis. High-energy irradiation allows the chemical crosslinking without the use of crosslinking agents, while the introduction of other natural or synthetic polymers offers a convenient way to modify the gels. In this study we examined the effect of the addition of starch, a low-cost renewable polysaccharide, on the properties of carboxymethylcellulose-based hydrogels.
   Results: Superabsorbent gels were prepared by gamma irradiation from aqueous mixtures of carboxymethylcellulose and starch. The partial replacement of CMC with starch improved the gel fraction, while a slight increase in the water uptake was also observed. However, very high starch content had a negative impact on the gelation, resulting in a decrease in gel fraction. Moreover, higher solute concentrations were preferred for the gelation of CMC/starch than for pure CMC. Hydrogels containing 30% starch showed the best properties: a water uptake of similar to 350 g(water)/g(gel) was achieved with similar to 55% gel fraction synthesized from 15 w/w% solutions at 20 kGy. Heterogeneous gel structure was observed: the starch granules and fragments were dispersed in the CMC matrix. The swelling of CMC/starch gels showed a high sensitivity to the ionic strength in water due to the CMC component. However, the mixed gels are less sensitive to the ionic strength than pure CMC gels.
   Conclusions: The introduction of starch to carboxymethylcellulose systems led to improved properties. Such gels showed higher water uptake, especially in an environment with high electrolyte concentration. CMC/starch hydrogels may offer a cheaper, superior alternative compared to pure cellulose derivative-based gels depending on the application.

TI Development and application of triple antibody sandwich enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assays for begomovirus detection using monoclonal
   antibodies against Tomato yellow leaf curl Thailand virus
SO VIROLOGY JOURNAL
AB Background: Tomato yellow leaf curl Thailand virus, TYLCTHV, is a begomovirus that causes severe losses of tomato crops in Thailand as well as several countries in Southeast and East Asia. The development of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and serological methods for detecting TYLCTHV is essential for epidemiological studies and screening for virus-resistant cultivars.
   Methods: The recombinant coat protein (CP) of TYLCTHV was expressed in Escherichia coli and used to generate MAbs against TYLCTHV through hybridoma technology. The MAbs were characterized and optimized to develop triple antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (TAS-ELISAs) for begomovirus detection. The efficiency of TAS-ELISAs for begomovirus detection was evaluated with tomato, pepper, eggplant, okra and cucurbit plants collected from several provinces in Thailand. Molecular identification of begomoviruses in these samples was also performed through PCR and DNA sequence analysis of the CP gene.
   Results: Two MAbs (M1 and D2) were generated and used to develop TAS-ELISAs for begomovirus detection. The results of begomovirus detection in 147 field samples indicated that MAb M1 reacted with 2 begomovirus species, TYLCTHV and Tobacco leaf curl Yunnan virus (TbLCYnV), whereas MAb D2 reacted with 4 begomovirus species, TYLCTHV, TbLCYnV, Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) and Squash leaf curl China virus (SLCCNV). Phylogenetic analyses of CP amino acid sequences from these begomoviruses revealed that the CP sequences of begomoviruses recognized by the narrow-spectrum MAb M1 were highly conserved, sharing 93% identity with each other but only 72-81% identity with MAb M1-negative begomoviruses. The CP sequences of begomoviruses recognized by the broad-spectrum MAb D2 demonstrated a wider range of amino acid sequence identity, sharing 78-96% identity with each other and 72-91% identity with those that were not detected by MAb D2.
   Conclusions: TAS-ELISAs using the narrow-specificity MAb M1 proved highly efficient for the detection of TYLCTHV and TbLCYnV, whereas TAS-ELISAs using the broad-specificity MAb D2 were highly efficient for the detection of TYLCTHV, TbLCYnV, ToLCNDV and SLCCNV. Both newly developed assays allow for sensitive, inexpensive, high-throughput detection of begomoviruses in field plant samples, as well as screening for virus-resistant cultivars.

TI Food beliefs and practices among the Kalenjin pregnant women in rural
   Uasin Gishu County, Kenya
SO JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
AB Background: Understanding food beliefs and practices is critical to the development of dietary recommendations, nutritional programmes, and educational messages. This study aimed to understand the pregnancy food beliefs and practices and the underlying reasons for these among the contemporary rural Kalenjin communities of Uasin Gishu County, Kenya.
   Methods: Through semi-structured interviews, data was collected from 154 pregnant and post-natal Kalenjin women about restricted and recommended foods, and why they are restricted or recommended during pregnancy. Respondents were purposively selected (based on diversity) from those attending Maternal and Child Health (MCH) care in 23 rural public health facilities. Key informant interviews (n = 9) with traditional Birth Attendants (TBA) who were also herbalists, community health workers, and nursing officers in charge of MCH were also conducted. Quantitative data was analysed using SPSS software. Data from respondents who gave consent to be tape recorded (n = 42) was transcribed and qualitatively analysed using MAXQDA software.
   Results: The restriction of animal organs specifically the tongue, heart, udder and male reproductive organs, meat and eggs, and the recommendation of traditional green vegetables and milk was reported by more than 60% of the respondents. Recommendation of fruits, traditional herbs, ugali (a dish made of maize flour, millet flour, or Sorghum flour, sometimes mixed with cassava flour), porridge and liver, and restriction of avocadoes and oily food were reported by more than 20% of the respondents. The reasons for observing these dietary precautions were mainly fears of: big foetuses, less blood, lack of strength during birth, miscarriages or stillbirths, and maternal deaths as well as child's colic and poor skin conditions after birth.
   Conclusion: Pregnancy food beliefs were widely known and practised mainly to protect the health of the mother and child, and ensuring successful pregnancy outcome. Given the deep-rooted nature of the beliefs, it is advisable that when nutritious foods are restricted, nutritional interventions should rather search for alternative sources of nutrition which are available and considered to be appropriate for pregnancy. On the other hand, nutritional advice that does not address these health concerns and assumptions that underlie successful pregnancy and delivery is unlikely to be effective.

TI Synchrotron-based FTIR microspectroscopy of chili resistance induced by
   Bacillus subtilis strain D604 against anthracnose disease
SO JOURNAL OF PLANT INTERACTIONS
AB The aim of this study was to determine the resistance mechanisms of chili induced by the Bacillus subtilis strain D604 using synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy (SR-FTIR). In this study, the strain D604 reduced anthracnose disease severity in chili plants by approximately 31.10%. The SR-FTIR spectral changes from the epidermis and mesophyll leaf tissue revealed higher integral areas for the C=O ester from lipids, lignin, or pectin (1770-1700cm(-1)) as well as polysaccharides (1200-900cm(-1)) in the treated samples of D606 and distilled water and then challenge inoculation with chili anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum acutatum. The secondary structure of the Amide I protein failed to convert from alpha helices (centered at 1650cm(-1)) to beta sheets (centered at 1600cm(-1)) in the mesophyll of samples not treated with D604. This study suggested that the strain D604 induced resistance against anthracnose pathogen in chili by inducing cellular changes related to defense compounds involved in plant defense mechanism.

TI Expression patterns of members of the ethylene signaling-related gene
   families in response to dehydration stresses in cassava
SO PLOS ONE
AB Drought is the one of the most important environment stresses that restricts crop yield worldwide. Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is an important food and energy crop that has many desirable traits such as drought, heat and low nutrients tolerance. However, the mechanisms underlying drought tolerance in cassava are unclear. Ethylene signaling pathway, from the upstream receptors to the downstream transcription factors, plays important roles in environmental stress responses during plant growth and development. In this study, we used bioinformatics approaches to identify and characterize candidate Manihot esculenta ethylene receptor genes and transcription factor genes. Using computational methods, we localized these genes on cassava chromosomes, constructed phylogenetic trees and identified stress-responsive cis-elements within their 5' upstream regions. Additionally, we measured the trehalose and proline contents in cassava fresh leaves after drought, osmotic, and salt stress treatments, and then it was found that the regulation patterns of contents of proline and trehalose in response to various dehydration stresses were differential, or even the opposite, which shows that plant may take different coping strategies to deal with different stresses, when stresses come. Furthermore, expression profiles of these genes in different organs and tissues under non-stress and abiotic stress were investigated through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses in cassava. Expression profiles exhibited clear differences among different tissues under non-stress and various dehydration stress conditions. We found that the leaf and tuberous root tissues had the greatest and least responses, respectively, to drought stress through the ethylene signaling pathway in cassava. Moreover, tuber and root tissues had the greatest and least reponses to osmotic and salt stresses through ethylene signaling in cassava, respectively. These results show that these plant tissues had differential expression levels of genes involved in ethylene signaling in response to the stresses tested. Moreover, after several gene duplication events, the spatiotemporally differential expression pattern of homologous genes in response to abiotic and biotic stresses may imply their functional diversity as a mechanism for adapting to the environment. Our data provide a framework for further research on the molecular mechanisms of cassava resistance to drought stress and provide a foundation for breeding drought-resistant new cultivars.

TI Molecular diversity analysis, drought related marker-traits association
   mapping and discovery of excellent alleles for 100-day old plants by
   EST-SSRs in cassava germplasms (Manihot esculenta Cranz)
SO PLOS ONE
AB Cassava is the third largest food crop of the world and has strong ability of drought tolerance. In order to evaluate the molecular diversity and to discover novel alleles for drought tolerance in cassava germplasms, we examined a total of 107 abiotic stress related expressed sequence tags-simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers in 134 cassava genotypes coming from planting regions worldwide and performed drought related marker-traits association mapping. As results, we successfully amplified 98 of 107 markers in 97 polymorphic loci and 279 alleles, with 2.87 alleles per locus, gene diversity of 0.48 and polymorphic information content (PIC) of 0.41 on average. The genetic coefficient between every two lines was 0.37 on average, ranging from 0.21 to 0.82. According to our population structure analysis, these samples could be divided into three sub-populations showing obvious gene flow between them. We also performed water stress experiments using 100-day old cassava plants in two years and calculated the drought tolerance coefficients (DTCs) and used them as phenotypes for marker-trait association mapping. We found that 53 markers were significantly associated with these drought-related traits, with a contribution rate for trait variation of 8.60% on average, ranging between 2.66 and 28.09%. Twenty-four of these 53 associated genes showed differential transcription or protein levels which were confirmed by qRT-PCR under drought stress when compared to the control conditions in cassava. Twelve of twenty-four genes were the same differential expression patterns in omics data and results of qRT-PCR. Out of 33 marker-traits combinations on 24 loci, 34 were positive and 53 negative alleles according to their phenotypic effects and we also obtained the typical materials which carried these elite alleles. We also found 23 positive average allele effects while 10 loci were negative according to their allele effects (AAEs). Our results on molecular diversity, locus association and differential expression under drought can prove beneficial to select excellent materials through marker assisted selection and for functional genes research in the future.

TI Time-resolved dual transcriptomics reveal early induced Nicotiana
   benthamiana root genes and conserved infection-promoting Phytophthora
   palmivora effectors
SO BMC BIOLOGY
AB Background: Plant-pathogenic oomycetes are responsible for economically important losses in crops worldwide. Phytophthora palmivora, a tropical relative of the potato late blight pathogen, causes rotting diseases in many tropical crops including papaya, cocoa, oil palm, black pepper, rubber, coconut, durian, mango, cassava and citrus. Transcriptomics have helped to identify repertoires of host-translocated microbial effector proteins which counteract defenses and reprogram the host in support of infection. As such, these studies have helped in understanding how pathogens cause diseases. Despite the importance of P. palmivora diseases, genetic resources to allow for disease resistance breeding and identification of microbial effectors are scarce.
   Results: We employed the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana to study the P. palmivora root infections at the cellular and molecular levels. Time-resolved dual transcriptomics revealed different pathogen and host transcriptome dynamics. De novo assembly of P. palmivora transcriptome and semi-automated prediction and annotation of the secretome enabled robust identification of conserved infection-promoting effectors. We show that one of them, REX3, suppresses plant secretion processes. In a survey for early transcriptionally activated plant genes we identified a N. benthamiana gene specifically induced at infected root tips that encodes a peptide with danger-associated molecular features.
   Conclusions: These results constitute a major advance in our understanding of P. palmivora diseases and establish extensive resources for P. palmivora pathogenomics, effector-aided resistance breeding and the generation of induced resistance to Phytophthora root infections. Furthermore, our approach to find infection-relevant secreted genes is transferable to other pathogen-host interactions and not restricted to plants.

TI Crystallization behavior studied by synchrotron small-angle X-ray
   scattering of poly (lactic acid)/cellulose nanofibers composites
SO COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this study, synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technique was applied to study the crystallization behavior of poly (lactic acid) (PLA)/cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) biocomposites. Morphological properties of the biocomposites were elucidated as well. PLA/CNFs biocomposites were prepared by melt mixing in an internal mixer. Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) grafted poly (lactic acid) (PIA-g-GMA) was used as a compatibilizer between CNFs and PLA. CNFs were extracted from cassava pulp (CP) by acid hydrolysis method. Effect of CNFs content on the crystallization behavior of the biocomposites was studied. The SAXS results showed that with the addition of 0.1 wt% CNFs arid using PLA-g-GMA as a compatibilizer, the crystallization rate of biocomposites significantly increased. The paracrystalline model was applied and well fitted to the SAXS data. The average long period (L) and lamellar thickness (L-c) determined by applying the paracrystalline model of PLA, PLA-g-GMA, and PLA/PLA-g-GMA/CNFs biocomposites exhibited a slight decrease in the very early stages of crystallization, then become time independent. The fiber content of 0.1 wt% was found to give the highest crystallization rate of both PLA/ CNFs and PLA/PLA-g-GMA/CNFs biocomposites. The enhanced interfacial adhesion between PLA and CNFs by PLA-g-GMA was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Nondairy beverage produced by controlled fermentation with potential
   probiotic starter cultures of lactic acid bacteria and yeast
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY
AB This work aimed to develop a nondairy fermented beverage from a blend of cassava and rice based on Brazilian indigenous beverage cauim using probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeast. The indigenous strains Lactobacillus plantarum CCMA 0743 (from cauim) and Torulaspora delbrueckii CCMA 0235 (from tarubd), and the commercial probiotic, L. acidophilus LAC-04, were used as starter cultures in single and co-cultivations. The bacteria populations were around 8.0 log (CFU/mL) at the end of all fermentations as recommended for probiotic products. Higher residual starch contents were noted in the single LAB cultures (10.6% [w/w]) than in co-cultures (<6% [w/w]), showing that co-culture may help the digestibility. For all different assays (single and co-culture), lactic acid was the main organic acid detected (>1.6 g/L) and ethanol was lower than 0.5% (w/v) consisting in a non-alcoholic beverage. The assays containing yeast showed the highest antioxidant activity (around 10% by DPPH and ABTS methods). Therefore, a nondairy fermented beverage was successfully obtained, and the co-culture of LAB and T. delbrueckii could increase the product's functional properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Expression of a mutated SPT15 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae enhances
   both cell growth and ethanol production in microaerobic batch,
   fed-batch, and simultaneous saccharification and fermentations
SO APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB The SPT15 gene encodes a Saccharomyces cerevisiae TATA-binding protein, which is able to globally control the transcription levels of various metabolic and regulatory genes. In this study, a SPT15 gene mutant (S42N, S78R, S163P, and I212N) was expressed in S. cerevisiae BY4741 (BSPT15-M3), of which effects on fermentative yeast properties were evaluated in a series of culture types. By applying different nitrogen sources and air supply conditions in batch culture, organic nitrogen sources and microaerobic condition were decided to be more favorable for both cell growth and ethanol production of the BSPT15-M3 strain than the control S. cerevisiae BY4741 strain expressing the SPT15 gene (BSPT15wt). Microaerobic fed-batch cultures of BSPT15-M3 with glucose shock in the presence of high ethanol content resulted in a 9.5-13.4% higher glucose consumption rate and ethanol productivity than those for the BSPT15wt strain. In addition, BSPT15-M3 showed 4.5 and 3.9% increases in ethanol productivity from cassava hydrolysates and corn starch in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation processes, respectively. It was concluded that overexpression of the mutated SPT15 gene would be a potent strategy to develop robust S. cerevisiae strains with enhanced cell growth and ethanol production abilities.

TI Effect of starch type on the physico-chemical properties of edible films
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB Food preservation is mostly related to packaging in oil-based plastics, inducing environmental problems, but this drawback could be limited by using edible/biodegradable films and coatings. Physical and chemical properties were assessed and reflect the role of the starch type (wheat, corn or potato) and thus that of the amylose/amylopectin ratio, which influences thickness, colour, moisture, wettability, thermal, surface and mechanical properties. Higher amylose content in films induces higher moisture sensitivity, and thus affects the mechanical and barrier properties. Films made from potato starch constitute a greater barrier for oxygen and water vapour though they have weaker mechanical properties than wheat and corn starch films. Starch species with higher amylose content have lower wettability properties, and better mechanical resistance, which strongly depends on the water content due to the hydrophilic nature of starch films, so they could be used for products with higher water activity, such as cheese, fruits and vegetables. It especially concerns wheat starch systems, and the contact angle indicates less hydrophilic surfaces (above 90) than those of corn and potato starch films (below 90). The starch origin influences optical properties and thickness: with more amylose, films are opalescent and thicker; with less, they are transparent and thinner. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Effects of tempering (annealing), acid hydrolysis, low-citric acid
   substitution on chemical and physicochemical properties of starches of
   four yam (Dioscorea spp.) cultivars
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-MYSORE
AB The effects of tempering (annealing), acid hydrolysis and low-citric acid substitution on chemical and physicochemical properties of starches of four Nigerian yam cultivars were investigated. Crude fat and protein contents of the native starches decreased significantly after the modifications, while nitrogen-free extract increased significantly with acid hydrolysis and citric acid substitution. Acid hydrolysis and low-citric acid substitution reduced the least concentration for gel formation of the starches from 4 to 2% w/v, but tempering had no effect. Swelling power of the starches reduced significantly, and water solubility increased significantly at 75 and 85 A degrees C, especially with acid hydrolysis and low-citric acid substitution. However, tempering significantly reduced starch solubility in the four cultivars. Paste clarity of starches of white (29.17%), water (18.90%), yellow (30.90%) and bitter (10.57%) yams reduced significantly with tempering to 14.43, 11.83, 16.93 and 7.27%, but increased significantly with acid hydrolysis to 41.40, 35.37, 28.77 and 32.33%, and low-citric acid substitution to 36.60, 44.17, 50.67 and 14.33%, respectively. Pasting properties such as peak, trough, breakdown, final, and setback viscosities and peak time of native starches reduced significantly with acid hydrolysis and low-citric acid substitution, however, tempering significantly increased their pasting temperature, peak time, setback and final viscosities.

TI In vitro and invivo evaluation of Weissella cibaria and Lactobacillus
   plantarum for their protective effect against cadmium and lead
   toxicities
SO LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB Thirty-two lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates were obtained from fermenting cassava mash and wara (African soft cheese) and screened for their resistance to cadmium and lead toxicities at 550-1050mgl(-1) and probiotic potentials. Four LAB strains that tolerated the heavy metals at 1050mgl(-1) were selected for antioxidative capacities, tolerance to acid, bile salts and simulated gastric and intestinal tract and safety status. The results revealed that Weissella cibaria WD2 and Lactobacillus plantarum CaD1 exhibited comparatively higher antioxidative capacities, survived in simulated gastric and intestinal transit, tolerated acid and bile salt and possessed safety status. The two strains were employed for the invivo studies, which was monitored in male albino Wistar rats using skim milk as a carrier for the cultures over a period of 28days. The rats given the cultures of W.cibaria WD2 and L.plantarum CaD1 in addition with the administration of heavy metals had improved renal and hepatic impairment, while damage was observed in rats fed with cadmium and lead only. Weissella cibaria WD2 and L.plantarum CaD1 demonstrated probiotic potentials and safety status. These strains can be used to effectively amend hepatic and renal histopathological alterations in rats caused by ingestion of cadmium and lead.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThis present study highlights the presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from traditional fermented foods that were cadmium and lead resistant and possessed probiotic potentials. Weissella cibaria WD2 and Lactobacillus plantarum CaD1 selected for the invivo studies ameliorated the build-up of cadmium and lead in the organs of the animals. This indicated that good cadmium and lead binding and probiotic lactic acid bacteria can be used to prevent exposure to these heavy metals.

TI Cassava C-repeat binding factor 1 gene responds to low temperature and
   enhances cold tolerance when overexpressed in Arabidopsis and cassava
SO PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Low temperature is a major abiotic stress factor affecting survival, productivity and geographic distribution of important crops worldwide. The C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element binding transcription factors (CBF/DREB) are important regulators of abiotic stress response in plants. In this study, MeCBF1, a CBF-like gene, was identified in the tropical root crop cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). The MeCBF1 encodes a protein that shares strong homology with DREB1As/CBFs from Arabidopsis as well as other species. The MeCBF1 was localized to the nucleus and is mainly expressed in stem and mature leaves, but not in apical buds or stem cambium. MeCBF1 expression was not only highly responsive to cold, but also significantly induced by salt, PEG and ABA treatment. Several stress-associated cis-elements were found in its promoter region, e.g., ABRE-related, MYC recognition sites, and MYB responsive element. Compared with AtCBF1, the MeCBF1 expression induced by cold in cassava was retarded and upregulated only after 4 h, which was also confirmed by its promoter activity. Overexpression of MeCBF1 in transgenic Arabidopsis and cassava plants conferred enhanced crytolerance. The CBF regulon was smaller and not entirely co-regulated with MeCBF1 expression in overexpressed cassava. The retarded MeCBF1 expression in response to cold and attenuated CBF-regulon might lead cassava to chilling sensitivity.

TI Biomass and bioenergy potential of cassava waste in Nigeria: Estimations
   based partly on rural-level garri processing case studies
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Advocating production of bio-energy from agricultural crop wastes has double benefits of minimizing land usage and threat to food security. These benefits are specially needed now that issues of greenhouse emissions, deforestation and human over population of the world dominate international discuss. Cassava being a major food crop in Africa, its waste constitutes the major candidate for bio-energy production thus motivating the aim to review its history, production, food value, economic value and bio-energy value. Cassava waste is noted to be suitable feedstock for bio-fuel production from the 1st Generation, 2nd Generation and integrated processes unlike the other Nigerian crop residues that are mainly suitable for the not-yet-viable 2nd Generation bio-fuel production. A procedure for estimating cassava non-food biomass(CnFB) from harvest data is established. The procedure entails use of statistical sampling and regression analysis to establish scaling factors for transforming the data to CnFB. A real case study reflected very accurate and statistically significant error indices. For example, the factor for converting mass of harvested cassava for food production to waste is R-w = 0.5263 (R-2 = 0.9875 and t-Test = 0.0896) while the factor for estimating mass of peels alone is R-12 = 0.1735 (R-2 = 0.9951 and t-Test = 0.1680). The other factors for converting mass of dewatered cassava pulp to waste were established for the case study community as follows; m(w) = 33.7675 Kg per bag (R-2 = 0.9611 and t-Test = 0.0665), m(3)=32.0599 kg per bag (R-2 = 0.9865 and t-Test = 0.1944) and r(w) = 1.0508 (R-2 = 0.9464 and t-Test = 0.2539). The factors and literature data were used to make long-term projections of CnFB potential of Nigeria. The implications of the projections to the programs of the Nigeria Energy Policy - which pertain to renewable energy integration in the national energy mix, emission reduction and rural electrification via distributed generation - were discussed.

TI Effect of heat-moisture treatment on morphological, structural and
   functional characteristics of ball-milled wheat starches
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB The effect of heat-moisture treatment (HMT) on the physicochemical properties of ball-milling (BM) modified wheat starch was investigated. The results showed that the damaged starch (DS) content and swelling power of BM modified starches decreased while their solubility increased by HMT. The gelatinization temperature of all the treated starches increased on HMT. However, the ball-milling-heat-moisture treatment (BM-HMT) starches had lower gelatinization temperature than the HMT starch without BM pretreatment. In addition, the BM-HMT starches displayed biphasic endotherms that differed from the BM starches. The crystallinity of starches milled for 0 to 1, 3, and 5 h increased by 5.50, 7.90, 3.50, and 10.30% on HMT, respectively, indicating that a certain degree of granule damage caused by BM treatment prior to HMT can enhance the mobility and realignment of resulting chains during HMT. The viscosities of the BM starches decreased on HMT, indicating enhanced shear stability and reduced retrogradation, which was similar to the effect of HMT on native starch. However, the peak, trough, and final viscosities of BM starches showed a smaller decline than that of native starch by HMT. These results demonstrate that BM-HMT can be a potential and beneficial method for wheat starch modification, providing desirable properties for food industries.

TI Photochemical Elimination of Endocrine Disrupting Chemical (EDC) by ZnO
   Nanoparticles, Synthesized by Gel Combustion
SO WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
AB Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles prepared by gel combustion synthesis using cassava pearl starch have been characterized by various microscopy and spectroscopy techniques. The particle size averaged around 45 nm, revealed zincite structure, hexagonal, agglomerated morphology and possessed an excellent photocatalytic activity in sunlight. Contrary to the existing literature survey, this photocatalyst possessed a band gap of 2.7 eV, causing an extended absorption towards broader range of the solar spectrum, thus making it an excellent visible light-activated photocatalyst. Photocatalytic activity was investigated on one of the highly resistant, most-focused endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) benzophenone-3 (BP-3), which is used in personnel care products. The observations reveal a near complete photooxidative degradation of BP-3. A reaction mechanism for the photooxidative pathway was proposed based on the isolated intermediates.

TI Drying Kinetics Modeling of Agricultural Commodities Using Infrared
   Dryer
SO AGRITECH-JURNAL TEKNOLOGI PERTANIAN
AB The drying kinetics study was carried out on agricultural commodities using an infrared dryer at temperature 60 degrees C. The aim of this study was to determine a drying model and effective moisture diffusivity that showed the drying characteristics of cassava slices, banana slices and groundnut pods. The experiments were conducted at three agricultural commodities (cassava, banana, and groundnut) at two capacity levels of 12 kg and 24 kg. Drying was done by arranging the agricultural material on tray of 0.5 kg and 1 kg for the treatment of 12 kg capacity and 24 kg capacity, respectively. A total of 24 trays were inserted into the dryer and every hour sample was taken to analyze the water content by gravimetric method. Data was fitted to four drying models and non-linear regression analysis was used to determine model parameters. The models were compared based on their coefficients of determination (R-2) between the experimental and predicted moisture ratios. The results showed that the increase of drying capacity would decrease the drying rate for all agricultural commodities. The Page model was showed to the best for describing the drying behaviour for these agricultural products. Effective moisture diffusivity ranged between 1.34x10(-10) m(2)/s - 3.23x10(-10) m(2)/s.

TI Structure, Expression, and Functional Analysis of the Hexokinase Gene
   Family in Cassava
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Hexokinase (HXK) proteins play important roles in catalyzing hexose phosphorylation and sugar sensing and signaling. To investigate the roles of HXKs in cassava tuber root development, seven HXK genes (MeHXK1-7) were isolated and analyzed. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the MeHXK family can be divided into five subfamilies of plant HXKs. MeHXKs were clearly divided into type A (MeHXK1) and type B (MeHXK2-7) based on their N-terminal sequences. MeHXK1-5 all had typical conserved regions and similar protein structures to the HXKs of other plants; while MeHXK6-7 lacked some of the conserved regions. An expression analysis of the MeHXK genes in cassava organs or tissues demonstrated that MeHXK2 is the dominant HXK in all the examined tissues (leaves, stems, fruits, tuber phloems, and tuber xylems). Notably, the expression of MeHXK2 and the enzymatic activity of HXK were higher at the initial and expanding tuber stages, and lower at the mature tuber stage. Furthermore, the HXK activity of MeHXK2 was identified by functional complementation of the HXK-deficient yeast strain YSH7.4-3C (hxk1, hxk2, glk1). The gene expression and enzymatic activity of MeHXK2 suggest that it might be the main enzyme for hexose phosphorylation during cassava tuber root development, which is involved in sucrose metabolism to regulate the accumulation of starch.

TI Origins, production, and utilization of cassava in Burkina Faso, a
   contribution of a neglected crop to household food security
SO FOOD SCIENCE & NUTRITION
AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a food plant introduced in Africa from America by the Portuguese in 1558. The objective of this study is to establish cassava origins, production, and utilization in Burkina Faso. The investigation was carried out in the regions of Center West, Cascades, Boucle du Mouhoun, Hauts Bassins, South West, and Center East of Burkina Faso. Eighteen cassava processing units and 226 farmers in 57 communities from the selected regions have been involved in the survey. The investigation showed that cassava was introduced to Burkina Faso, former Upper Volta from the costal countries, Gold Coast (now Ghana), by both local traders and the Roman Catholic White missionaries. This happened between the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. The main variety introduced was Banfti. Some improved varieties like V5 (94/0270), Banke (V2), 68.61, 30572, KTMA developed by research are now available and used by farmers along with the traditional varieties like manchien, santidougou, tchinda yaar, leo. The cases of intoxication evoked by some farmers are evidence that some of those varieties may have a high level of cyanohydric acid content. Cassava is available all the year throughout the country. But the top of cassava production is reached in July. Most of the small-scale farmers (98%) grow cassava both for household use and as income generator. About 83.92% of cassava farmers have less than 10 tons as annual production and only 1.72% of them can produce more than 100 tons. The main food products based on cassava found in communities are raw roots, boiled roots, roasted roots, to, attieke, tapioca, ragout, beignets, boiled leaves, soup (with leaves), cassava juice, etc. And the main cassava-processed products in the processing units are attieke, gari, tapioca, and flour. Cassava contributes greatly to household food security during food shortage period. It sustains families for weeks as food and is also exchanged with other foods or sold to buy food or meet household needs.

TI Sensory optimization of crackers developed from high-quality cassava
   flour, starch, and prawn powder
SO FOOD SCIENCE & NUTRITION
AB Crackers produced from high-quality cassava flour (HQCF), cassava starch, and prawn powder were optimized based on sensory preference testing. Ten different formulations of crackers were produced using mixture design. These were subjected to sensory evaluation using attributes such as taste, crispiness, puffiness, and acceptability on a 7-point hedonic scale. A mean score of 4.7, 5.6, 5.2, and 5.2 was obtained correspondingly for taste, crispiness, puffiness, and acceptability. Scores for these attributes indicated that the crackers were acceptable. Mixture regression models were used to generate contour plots for the sensory attributes and these were superimposed to obtain an optimal region, from where an optimum formulation was chosen. Verification of the optimal formulation with acceptability studies confirmed that the newly developed snack had a likeness score of 6.3 and was highly acceptable to consumers. The study demonstrates the suitability of HQCF in processing value added snack products.

TI Nutritional and sensory properties: Snack food made from high-quality
   cassava flour and legume blend
SO FOOD SCIENCE & NUTRITION
AB The nutritional benefits of grain legumes such as cowpea and soybean in sub-Saharan Africa have not been fully utilized to alleviate problem of protein-malnutrition in this region. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the nutritional properties and sensory evaluation of snack food made from high-quality cassava flour (HQCF) and soy-beans (50: 50), and HQCF and cowpea (50: 50). Sensory evaluation was conducted among panellists in Nigeria and DR Congo. Results showed that the soy variant of the snack contained significantly higher protein than the cowpea variant. There was cross-cultural difference in snack preference between panellists in Nigeria and DR Congo. Panellists in DR Congo preferred the aroma of the unboiled soy variant, whereas panellists in Nigeria preferred the boiled soy variant more. This study showed the potential of legumes and cassava in the snack food sector not only as a partial substitute for wheat flour but as a major ingredient and also form basis for the new product development in the snacks food industry. The developed product could be possibly used to alleviate the protein-malnutrition among the vulnerable groups of most developing countries.

SO ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
AB The objective of this study was to propose a model, named Simanihot, for simulating growth, development and yield of tuberous roots in cassava, with a choice of two soil water balance models. The model works on a day time step and is calibrated for five cassava cultivars (Fepagro RS 14, Estrangeira, Cascuda, Sao Jose e Paraguaia), with different branching habits and different purpose of use (pasture, food and industry). The model has a graphical interface, where the user can choose one out of two soil water balance models, depending upon the number of known soil variables and details the user wants to know about soil water content.

TI OPTIMIZATION OF ANAEROBIC TREATMENT OF CASSAVA PROCESSING WASTEWATER
SO ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
AB The main contribution of this research is to optimize the operating conditions of an anaerobic reactor applied to the treatment of wastewater from cassava starch production. A 20-L anaerobic reactor was used, operating in a batch system, with temperature control. Temperature and inoculum total volatile solids (TVSi) were controlled for evaluation of effects on the removals of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and reactor total volatile solids (TVSr) by means of a Central Composite Rotational Design (CCRD). Twelve trials were analyzed simultaneously by the desirable function approach. The higher COD removal (96.82%) was obtained at 42 degrees C and 12.0% TVSi. The largest TVSr removal (69.31%) was registered at 45 degrees C and 10.0% TVSi. Equations representative of the process were obtained from the responses of variables, being statistically significant at a 90% confidence level. Based on the desirability function approach, we can conclude that an optimal operational condition for the anaerobic reactor is at 39.7 degrees C and 10.8% TVSi. The estimated COD and TVSr removal efficiencies under these operating conditions were 90.45% and 63.12%, respectively.

TI Contribution of hippocampal area CA1 to acetone cyanohydrin-induced loss
   of motor coordination in rats
SO NEUROLOGIA
AB Introduction: Some vegetable foodstuffs contain toxic compounds that, when consumed, favour the development of certain diseases. Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is an important food source, but it contains cyanogenic gtucosides (linamarin and lotaustralin) that have been associated with the development of tropical ataxic neuropathy and konzo. In rats, intraperitoneat administration of acetone cyanohydrin (a metabolite of linamarin) produces neurological disorders and neuronal damage in the hippocampus. However, it is unknown whether hippocampal area CA1 plays a role in neurological disorders associated with acetone cyanohydrin.
   Method: A total of 32 male Wistar rats 3 months old were assigned to 4 groups (n = 8 per group) as follows: vehicle (1 ill physiological saline), and 3 groups with acetone cyanohydrin (1 mu l of 10, 15, and 20 mM solution, respectively). The substances were microinjected intrahippocampally every 24 hours for 7 consecutive days, and their effects on locomotor activity, rota-rod and swim tests were assessed daily. On the fifth day post-treatment, rats underwent further assessment with behavioural tests to identify or rule out permanent damage induced by acetone cyanohydrin.
   Results: Microinjection of acetone cyanohydrin 20 mM resulted in hyperactivity, motor impairment, and reduced exploration from the third day of treatment. All concentrations of acetone cyanohydrin produced rotational behaviour in the swim test from the first day of microinjection.
   Conclusion: The hippocampal area CA1 is involved in motor alterations induced by microinjection of acetone cyanohydrin, as has been reported for other cassava compounds. (C) 2015 Sociedad Espanola de Neurologia. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

TI Bread quality of flours substituted with modified cassava starches
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB This study aimed to assess the application of modified cassava starches that were produced in Colombia to improve bread quality characteristics and to evaluate the synergies of these starches in the final product. Cross-linked and oxidized cassava starch binary blends were used as a partial wheat flour substitute at 5, 7, and 10%. The crumb moisture content, specific volume, height, and texture of the composite breads were determined. There were no significant differences (p<0.05) in the height or the yield of the breads. As the modified cassava starch binary blend increased to 10%, the crumb firmness and hardness increased and the specific volume decreased. The samples containing the modified cassava starch binary blend at a 5% wheat flour replacement level had the most similar textural properties to those of the wheat flour bread. However, this sample had the lower sensory acceptance test score at 7 days of storage, as compared to the wheat flour bread because of its higher firmness crumb.

TI Effects of pyroconversion and enzymatic hydrolysis on indigestible
   starch content and physicochemical properties of cassava (Manihot
   esculenta) starch
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) root is the second most important starch source worldwide and its cultivation could be potentially much greater. Pyrodextrins and enzyme-resistant maltodextrins were produced from cassava starch by pyroconversion and enzymatic hydrolysis. Changes in indigestible starch content and some physicochemical properties were analyzed. The best results were produced with a 160: 1 (m/v) starch: HCl ratio, 90 degrees C temperature, and 3 h reaction time. These conditions produced a pyrodextrin with 45.98% indigestible starch content and a color difference of 1.89. Optimum hydrolysis conditions were a 0.01% alpha-amylase concentration and 5 min reaction time, which produced a resistant maltodextrin with 24.45% dextrose equivalents and 56.06% indigestible starch content. Compared to the native starch, the pyrodextrin exhibited 93% solubility at 60 degrees C, and 100% at 70-90 degrees C. The resistant maltodextrin was completely soluble at all temperatures. The pyrodextrin had low water-absorption capacity (0.16-0.34 g water/g gel) and some swelling power, while the resistant maltodextrin had neither property, even at low temperatures. None of the compounds exhibited a gelatinization transition. The resistant maltodextrin's high indigestible starch content and solubility make it a promising ingredient for increasing dietary fiber content in a wide range of foods, particularly beverages, creams, soups, dairy and bread products.

TI Preparation and characterization of modified and functional starch
   (hexadecyl corboxymethyl starch) ether using reactive extrusion
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB Water-soluble carboxymethyl starch (CMS) derivatives with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic characteristics were synthesized by reacting CMS with cetyl bromide (CB) using an extrusion process in an alkaline etherification reaction. A series of hexadecyl carboxymethyl starch ethers (HCSE-ex) with degrees of substitution ranging from 0.0257 to 0.0701 were characterized under different reaction conditions based on their physical (morphology and viscosity) and thermal properties. FTIR, SEM, TGA, and X-ray results confirmed that etherification produced high reaction efficiencies, and the derivatives exhibited excellent emulsification efficiency. The application of extrusion as an energy source resulted in a much reduced etherification time compared with traditional methods, down from several hours to several seconds, indicating the high potential of extrusion to improve and increase the efficiency of technological polysaccharide etherification.

TI New opportunities and challenges to engineer disease resistance in
   cassava, a staple food of African small-holder farmers
SO PLOS PATHOGENS
AB The storage root crop cassava (Manihot esculenta) is the most important source of dietary calories in the tropics after rice and maize [1]. It plays a central role in food and economic security for small-holder farmers and holds unrealized potential as a cash and commodity crop. In Africa, cassava production is constrained by three major diseases: cassava mosaic disease (CMD), cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), and cassava bacterial blight (CBB) [2]. Strong inbreeding depression and heterozygosity present challenges to conventional cassava breeding programs. While important advances are being made with genotype-by-sequencing technologies and marker-assisted breeding, these techniques alone will not unlock the crop's full potential. Historically, cassava has received less research investment than other major crops. Over the last decade, however, multiple genomic platforms and diverse germplasm collections have been developed, along with effective genetic transformation protocols. As a result, numerous reports of genetically engineered cassava have now been published (see Chavarriaga-Aguirre and colleagues) [3]. Here, we briefly summarize previous efforts with an emphasis on technologies relevant to small-holder farmers in Africa. In addition, we discuss new opportunities for using genome-editing technologies to create disease-resistant cassava plants. We conclude by highlighting additional challenges that must be overcome prior to delivering biotechnology-improved cassava varieties to small-holder farmers in Africa.

TI RNAi inhibition of feruloyl CoA 6 '-hydroxylase reduces scopoletin
   biosynthesis and post-harvest physiological deterioration in cassava
   (Manihot esculenta Crantz) storage roots
SO PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a major world crop, whose storage roots provide food for over 800 million throughout the humid tropics. Despite many advantages as a crop, the development of cassava is seriously constrained by the rapid post-harvest physiological deterioration (PPD) of its roots that occurs within 24-72 h of harvest, rendering the roots unpalatable and unmarketable. PPD limits cassava's marketing possibilities in countries that are undergoing increased development and urbanisation due to growing distances between farms and consumers. The inevitable wounding of the roots caused by harvesting triggers an oxidative burst that spreads throughout the cassava root, together with the accumulation of secondary metabolites including phenolic compounds, of which the coumarin scopoletin (7-hydroxy-6-methoxy-2-H- 1-benzopyran-2-one) is the most abundant. Scopoletin oxidation yields a blue-black colour, which suggests its involvement in the discoloration observed during PPD. Feruloyl CoA 6'-hydroxylase is a controlling enzyme in the biosynthesis of scopoletin. The cassava genome contains a seven membered family of feruloyl CoA 6'-hydroxylase genes, four of which are expressed in the storage root and, of these, three were capable of functionally complementing Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutants in this gene. A RNA interference construct, designed to a highly conserved region of these genes, was used to transform cassava, where it significantly reduced feruloyl CoA 6'-hydroxylase gene expression, scopoletin accumulation and PPD symptom development. Collectively, our results provide evidence that scopoletin plays a major functional role in the development of PPD symptoms, rather than merely paralleling symptom development in the cassava storage root.

TI Cassava derivatives in ice cream formulations: effects on
   physicochemical, physical and sensory properties
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-MYSORE
AB In the present study, the effects of derivatives of cassava, maltodextrin and bagasse, on the physicochemical, physical and sensory properties of ice creams were investigated. The content of cassava maltodextrin increased significantly the content of carbohydrate and total soluble solids and decreased lipids content. The effect of cassava bagasse was more pronounced than the maltodextrin on physical and sensory parameters. Increased percentage of cassava bagasse in formulation led to decrease of overrun, melting and luminosity, but increased hardness and unfreezable water. Sensory attributes were mainly influenced by cassava bagasse inclusion. The results suggested the potential use of cassava derivatives in ice cream formulations. Ice creams with low percentage of cassava bagasse (1.5) and intermediate values of cassava maltodextrin (3.65%) had good nutritional, technological and sensorial acceptance.

TI Impact of ecosystem carbon stock change on greenhouse gas emissions and
   carbon payback periods of cassava-based ethanol in Vietnam
SO BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB Cassava-based ethanol has been promoted in China and Southeast Asia as an effective means to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and promote energy security. However, existing life cycle assessments of the environmental impacts of cassava ethanol have used highly-aggregated empirical methods to estimate ecosystem C stock changes, which do not capture finer-scale characteristics of different cassava growing regions within a country. We investigated carbon debts, GHG emissions, and payback periods for cassava-based ethanol in Vietnam using a life cycle assessment approach coupled with the widely used ecosystem biogeochemical CENTURY model. The model simulated regionally-specific carbon stock changes associated with cassava cultivation for biofuel feedstock under different land use change, cassava yield and fertilization scenarios. We found that switching land use to cassava production for biofuel substantially reduced soil organic carbon in all major cassava growing regions in Vietnam. GHG emissions, carbon debts, and payback periods of Vietnam's cassava ethanol were strongly dependent on cassava yield. The mean carbon debt due to direct land use change to cassava production for ethanol ranged from 66 to 97 Mg of CO2 per hectare, and the net carbon dioxide equivalent emission of cassava based ethanol ranged from 36 to 95 g MJ(-1), depending on the range of cassava fresh weight yield (from 18 to 60 Mg ha(-1)). To repay a carbon debt from direct land use change within 25 years, the average fresh weight yield of cassava used as feedstock for ethanol production must be above 33 Mg ha-1. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Determination of copper total and speciation in food samples by flame
   atomic absorption spectrometry in association with solid-phase
   extraction with bamboo (Bambusa vulgaris) fiber loaded with
   bathocuproine
SO MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB A bamboo fiber mini-column impregnated with bathocuproine is proposed as an off-line pre-concentration system for determination of copper speciation in food samples using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). Sampling flow rate, elution flow rate, pH and buffer concentration were evaluated for their importance in the solid-phase extraction using a 2(4) full factorial design and were all found to be significant. Afterward, a Doehlert matrix was used to optimize the pre-concentration process. The experimental conditions established with this design were: 8.0 mL min(-1) sampling flow rate, 10.0 mL min(-1) elution flow rate and 0.02 mol L-1 buffer at pH 5.5. This system allowed the determination of copper with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.5 mg L-1, a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1.6614 L-1 and a precision expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD) of 2.70 and 2.79% for copper concentrations of 5.0 and 20 mu g L-1, respectively. A pre-concentration factor of 33 was achieved using a 50.0-mL sample volume. The accuracy was confirmed by analysis of a certified reference material (NISTSRM 1573a Tomato Leaves). Spike/recovery tests were performed with results ranging from 93 to 100%. The developed method was applied to determine copper in corn flour, cassava root flour, oregano leaves and cumin. In addition, a speciation strategy was used for wine samples, in which free copper was evaluated in 40.00-mL aliquots of undigested samples and total copper assessed in samples digested before the pre-concentration step.

TI Comparative study of the influence of chitosan as coating of
   thermoplastic starch foam from potato, cassava and corn starch
SO PROGRESS IN ORGANIC COATINGS
AB The expanded polystyrene (EPS) is used in a variety of food packaging, mainly in packages whose characteristics is the single use. These packages are usually discarded soon and generate large amounts of waste. Thermoplastic starch (TPS) foams can replace the EPS in these cases, because it comes from renewable and biodegradable sources. However, TPS packaging has great affinity for water and it affects its use. One way to solve this problem is to cover the TPS foam with a more hydrophobic material, hindering the contact of water with starch. In this work, chitosan was used as coating, since it is also a biodegradable material and more hydrophobic than starch. Three sources of starch (potato, cassava and corn) were analyzed conjointly to produce TPS foams. The foams were made from starch, glycerol and water in the weight proportion of 62/5/33. Results showed that TPS foams made from corn starch are denser and have greater modulus compared to other foams. The chitosan coating decreased water absorption and increased the tensile strength in TPS foams. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Quantitative trait loci underlying root yield and starch content in an
   F-1 derived cassava population (Manihot esculenta Crantz)
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) root yield measured as fresh weight (hereafter root yield) is declining in much of Asia and Africa. The current study aimed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying both root and starch fresh weights in F-1 cassava. Eight QTL were associated with root yield, underlying 129-400% of the phenotypic variation (PVE). Nine QTL were associated with starch content, underlying 113-273% of the PVE. Quantitative trait loci were identified from four different environments that encompassed two locations and 3 years. Consistent QTL for root yield, YLD5_R11 and YLD8_L09 on linkage group (LG) 16, were detected across years and locations. Quantitative trait loci for starch content, ST3_R09, ST6_R10 and ST7_R11 on LG 11, were found across 3 years. Co-localization of QTL for both traits with positive correlation was detected between YLD3_R10 and ST5_R10 on LG 9. Candidate genes within the QTL that were consistent across multiple environments were identified based on cassava genome sequences. Genes predicted to encode for glycosyl hydrolases, uridine 5'-diphospho-(UDP)-glucuronosyl transferases and UDP-glucosyl transferases were found among the 44 genes located within the region containing the QTL controlling starch content. Sixteen genes predicted to encode proteins that were possibly associated with root yield were identified. The QTL controlling root yield and starch content in the current study will be useful for molecular breeding of cassava through marker-assisted selection. The identification of candidate genes underlying both traits will be useful both as markers and for gene expression studies.

TI Utilization and fate of phosphorus of different sources applied to
   cohesive soil of Amazonian periphery
SO SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
AB In the Amazonian region, P is often a primary factor limiting sustainable agrosystems. We compared the efficiencies of local aluminous phosphate (ALP) and single superphosphate (SSP) under a cover of leguminous residues to determine the fate of P sources in an Amazonian soil with hardsetting characteristics. The experiment followed a randomized block design with four replications and the following treatments: ALPU, i.e. ALP plus urea (U); ALPL, i.e., ALP plus leucaena (L); SSPU, i.e., SSP plus urea; SSPL, i.e., SSP plus leucaena; and BS, i.e., bare soil (without residues). To assess the residual values of the P sources, we used a sequence of crops consisting of maize, cowpea and cassava. Both ALP and SSP exhibited low P efficiency in BS. The greatest amounts of P and N uptake in the plots where P sources and leucaena residues were added, as in those covered with leucaena residue, resulted in higher productivity levels. These differences are important for the adoption of beneficial soil management practices and the use of P sources to enhance efficiency in tropical soils. The use of residues increased the P use efficiency of both P sources, as it enhanced the uptake of both N and soluble P. The replacement of SSP with ALP may be advantageous in the second year of planting with high-demand crops, but the P of the SSP retained in the minus soluble fractions may be available if the SSP is used in P-depleting crops combined with no-tillage underneath a mulch of residues.

TI Does intercropping play a role in alleviating weeds in cassava as a
   non-chemical tool of weed management? - A review
SO CROP PROTECTION
AB Cassava is an important root and tuber crop in the tropics which requires intensive weed management at its early growth stages. This review emphasizes the potential of exploiting the option of intercropping as a non-chemical tool of weed management in cassava. The appropriateness and the significance of including intercropping solely and as a component of an integrated weed management system in cassava are further discussed. Literature suggests that intercropping is a successful option in managing weeds when the spatial and temporal compatibility of intercrop combinations is being achieved. In widespread cassava-based intercropping systems, intercropping itself has proven its ability to alleviate weeds up to 30-60%, or even up to 100% with the selection of a better compatible crop mixture such as the cassava pumpkin intercrop combination. A number of studies conducted to ascertain the appropriate spatial and temporal compatibility levels of many intercrop combinations have provided evidence of their weed suppressive ability in cassava-based intercropping systems. The focus of such studies towards the basic agronomic, physiological and biochemical determinants of crop-weed interactions seems rather constricted. In conclusion, intercropping is suggested to be exploited as an effective weed management tool in cassava preferably through further research, prior to endorsing it as a proper alternative to chemical weed control measures, especially for the resource poor farmers who probably can neither afford herbicides nor labour-intensive cultural methods for weed management.

TI Adding value through the mechanization of post-harvest cassava
   processing, and its impact on household poverty in north-eastern Zambia
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB This article investigates the impact of adopting a mechanized cassava processing system on household poverty levels in Zambia. An Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (FGT) poverty measure was used to compare poverty levels among households using a mechanized cassava processing system against those households using a nonmechanized process. Based on the FGT poverty measure's specifications, a significantly lower poverty status of 49% was found among households using the mechanized process when compared to the 58% found among households using the nonmechanized process. The significant factors contributing to these differences in poverty levels include whether households are using a mechanized process or not, the number of years' schooling among household members, the number of years' farming experience, household income and membership of associations. The study concludes that the mechanization of cassava processing, particularly if done on the right scale, can transform primary production activities, in turn leading to higher incomes and reduced poverty levels in rural villages. Thus, policies should be introduced aimed at encouraging the promotion of mechanized post-harvest cassava processing technologies among rural households, so as to enhance crop productivity and household income levels, as well as reduce poverty among rural households.

SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB After combined hydrolysis by alpha-amylase and beta-amylase at room temperature, spherical blocklets in diameters of 27-60 nm were observed on the surface of tapioca starch granules by scanning electron micrography (SEM). Tapioca starch (1%, w/w, db, distilled water) was heated by using a rapid visco analyzer (RVA) in four different programs, then the samples were settled and freeze dried, respectively. The SEM images showed that the blocklets swelled at 52 degrees C; the swollen blocklets deformed to olive shape, and linked by molecular chains, formed bead-like structure at 62 degrees C; they started to merge at 72 degrees C (pasting temperature); then the blocklets fused together and their shapes disappeared completely, and the gel network formed at 95 degrees C. Furthermore, the morphological changes of the blocklets were not simultaneously. 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Removal of Cd2(+) ions from aqueous solution using cassava starch-based
   superabsorbent polymers
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB A comprehensive feasibility study on the adsorption of Cd2(+) ions by cassava starch-based superabsorbent polymers (CSTSAPs) as the biosorbent was investigated as a function of adsorbent dosage, pH, initial concentration, contact time, and temperature. An orthogonal experiment and range analysis were applied to optimize the adsorption conditions. Adsorbent dosage and initial concentration were the most sensitive variables for adsorption capacity. The maximum adsorption value of Cd-2+ ions was determined as 347.46 mg/g at pH 6.0, initial concentration of 200 mg/L, and contact temperature and time of 323 K and 6 h, respectively, with 0.1 g adsorbent dosage. The equilibrium data were well described by a Langmuir model, and the adsorption process was well fitted by pseudo-second-order kinetics. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR) data confirmed that acrylic acid and acrylic amide grafted onto the cassava starch. The X-ray diffraction and FTIR results for the Cd-2+ -absorbed CST-SAP (CST-SAP-Cd-2+) samples showed that the CST-SAP could effectively adsorb Cd-2+ ions and that the characteristic groups were translocated by chelation. The scanning electron microscopy results for the CST-SAP revealed that the surface of the polymer was rough, and the layered structure that was full of folds caused an enhanced specific surface; such conditions were beneficial to Cd 21 ion adsorption. It was concluded that the CST-SAP was an excellent adsorbent for Cd-2+ ion removal from aqueous solution. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals,Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2017, 134, 44758.

TI Evaluation of spectral imaging for inspection of adulterants in terms of
   common wheat flour, cassava flour and corn flour in organic Avatar wheat
   (Triticum spp.) flour
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING
AB When considering food security and huge market interest, a high-efficiency method to ensure the authenticity of the food product is necessary. For this goal, spectral imaging was explored for quantitative detection of Irish organic wheat flour (OWF) adulterated with common wheat flour (WF), cassava flour (CaF) and corn flour (CoF). Hyperspectral images (900-1700 nm) of OWF samples with a series of adulteration percentages were collected. The acquired spectra were pre-processed by second derivative (2nd Der) and standard normal variate (SNV) before modelling. Then partial least squares regression (PLSR) and principal component regression (PCR) were employed for quantitative analysis of adulteration proportion of CoF, CaF and WF in OWF. To develop more effective simplified models, three groups of feature wavelengths were selected from the loading plots of principal component analysis (PCA), and first-derivative and mean centering iteration algorithm (FMCIA). The models developed using FMCIA were better than PCA. After, the corresponding feature wavelengths were further reduced based on model regression coefficients (RC). The optimal result of admixture detection was emerged by the RC-FMCIA-PLSR model, with a determination coefficient of prediction (R-p(2)) of 0.973 and a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.036 for OWF adulterated with CoF, R(2)p of 0.986 and RMSEP of 0.026 for OWF adulterated with CaF, and R(2)p of 0.971 and RMSEP of 0.038 for OWF adulterated with WE Visualization maps were generated by calculating the spectral response of each pixel on flour samples. This result indicates that spectral imaging integrated with multivariate analysis has the potential to authenticate the admixtures in specific wheat flour in the range of 3-75% (w/w).

TI Regional water footprints of potential biofuel production in China
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS
AB Background: Development of biofuels is considered as one of the important ways to replace conventional fossil energy and mitigate climate change. However, rapid increase of biofuel production could cause other environmental concerns in China such as water stress. This study is intended to evaluate the life-cycle water footprints (WF) of biofuels derived from several potential non-edible feedstocks including cassava, sweet sorghum, and Jatropha curcas in China. Different water footprint types including blue water, green water, and grey water are considered in this study. Based on the estimated WF, water deprivation impact and water stress degree on local water environment are further analyzed for different regions in China.
   Results: On the basis of the feedstock resource availability, sweet sorghum, cassava, and Jatropha curcas seeds are considered as the likely feedstocks for biofuel production in China. The water footprint results show that the feedstock growth is the most water footprint intensive process, while the biofuel conversion and transportation contribute little to total water footprints. Water footprints vary significantly by region with climate and soil variations. The life-cycle water footprints of cassava ethanol, sweet sorghum ethanol, and Jatropha curcas seeds biodiesel were estimated to be 73.9-222.2, 115.9-210.4, and 64.7-182.3 L of water per MJ of biofuel, respectively. Grey water footprint dominates the life-cycle water footprint for each type of the biofuels. Development of biofuels without careful water resource management will exert significant impacts on local water resources. The water resource impacts vary significantly among regions. For example, based on blue and grey water consumption, Gansu province in China will suffer much higher water stress than other regions do due to limited available water resources and large amount of fertilizer use in that province. In term of blue water, Shandongprovince is shown with the most severe water stress issue, followed by Gansu province, which is attributed to the limited water resources in both provinces.
   Conclusions: By considering feedstock resource distribution, biofuel production potentials, and estimated water footprints, this study provides insight into the impact of biofuel production on the local water environment in China. Biofuel development policies need to be carefully designed for the sustainable development of biofuels in China.

TI Microfibrillated nanocellulose from balsa tree as potential
   reinforcement in the preparation of 'green' composites with castor seed
   cake
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The search for and development of eco-friendly materials such as 'green' composites results from twin issues of sustainability and 'environmental impact'. Towards achieving this goal, the use of industrial residues such as plant fibers as reinforcement along with natural polymers has been yielding good results. However, due to limitations of industrial uptake of these materials in structural applications, reducing the size of fibers below the normal micro level offers advantages because of the improved behavior and functionality exhibited by the nano-sized cellulosic fibrous materials. Considering successful previous efforts to develop biodegradable composites using castor seed cake, this paper focuses on the possibility of developing 'green' composites using this material as matrix and nanocellulose prepared from balsa tree as reinforcement. The preparation of nanofibrillar cellulose through mechanical fibrillation and its characterization as well as preparation of nanocomposites by thermo-molding with a matrix plasticized by glycerin are presented. The incorporation of nanocellulose resulted in increased flexural modulus, swelling thickness, and water absorption with increasing addition of nanocellulose, while both apparent density and flexural strength remained unchanged. The observed properties are discussed based on fractographic studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A new biodegradable composite with open cell by combining modified
   starch and plant fibers
SO MATERIALS & DESIGN
AB Biodegradable composites with open cell structure were prepared through thermo-cavity foam molding using plant fibers and modified starch as main raw materials, and other additives as active agents. Oxidized starch (OS), thermoplastic starch (TPS), and thermoplastic oxidized starch (TPOS) were utilized to increase compatibility between starch and plant fibers and to improve mechanical properties of composites. Prepared composites were evaluated using tensile, compressive, and static compression tests. Results showed that TPOS improved the tensile strength by 69%in comparison with native starch (NS)-based composites. Considerable improvement was not observed in tensile strengths of OS-based and TPS-based composites. Following crystalline, hydrogen bond, and micro-structure of modified starch were researched to gain comprehensive view on mechanism of mechanical property changes in composites with NS, OS, TPS and TPOS. Fourier transform infrared analysis showed that new hydrogen bonds were formed between the plasticizer, oxidizer, and starch. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the crystallization was eliminated in TPOS. Restraining of starch re-crystallization was recognized as cause of changes in mechanical properties of composites. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that TPOS bonded tightly with plant fibers forming uniform open cell structure in the biodegradable composites. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Molecular structure, functionality and applications of oxidized
   starches: A review
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB During oxidation, the hydroxyl groups of starch molecules are first oxidized to carbonyl groups, then to carboxyl groups. The contents of the carbonyl and carboxyl groups in a starch molecule therefore indicate the extent of starch oxidation. The mechanisms of starch oxidation with different oxidizing agents, including sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, ozone and sodium periodate, are described in this review. The effects of these oxidizing agents on the molecular, physicochemical, thermal, pasting and morphological properties of starch are described as well. In addition, the main industrial applications of oxidized starches are presented. The present review is important for understanding the effects of oxidation on starch properties, and this information may facilitate the development of novel oxidized starches for both food and non-food applications.

TI Selection of morphoagronomic descriptors for the characterization of
   accessions of cassava of the Eastern Brazilian Amazon
SO GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH
AB The aim of this study was to select morphoagronomic descriptors to characterize cassava accessions representative of Eastern Brazilian Amazonia. It was characterized 262 accessions using 21 qualitative descriptors. The multiple-correspondence analysis (MCA) technique was applied using the criteria: contribution of the descriptor in the last factorial axis of analysis in successive cycles (SMCA); reverse order of the descriptor's contribution in the last factorial axis of analysis with all descriptors ('O' 'p') of Jolliffe's method; mean of the contribution orders of the descriptor in the first three factorial axes in the analysis with all descriptors ('Os') together with ('O' 'p'); and order of contribution of weighted mean in the first three factorial axes in the analysis of all descriptors ('Oz'). The dissimilarity coefficient was measured by the method of multicategorical variables. The correlation among the matrix generated with all descriptors and matrices based on each criteria varied (r = 0.21, r = 0.97, r = 0.98, r = 0.13 for SMCA, 'Os', 'Oz' and 'O' 'p', respectively). The least informative descriptors were discarded independently and according to both 'Os' and 'Oz' criteria. Thirteen descriptors were capable to discriminate the accessions and to represent the morphological variability of accessions sampled in Brazilian Eastern Amazonia: color of apical leaves, petiole color, color of stem exterior, external color of storage root, color of stem cortex, color of root pulp, texture of root epidermis, color of leaf vein, color of stem epidermis, color of end branches of adult plant, branching habit, root shape, and constriction of root.

TI Phenotypic diversity of starch granules in cassava germplasm
SO GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH
AB Demand for the development of cassava varieties with different native starches has guided the search for these characteristics in the germplasm of Manihot esculenta Crantz. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate the genetic diversity of cassava accessions for root and starch granule characteristics to guide the future industrial application of this species. Starches from 56 accessions were evaluated for the number of granules in 1 g of starch (NTG), area (AG, mm(2)), length (LG, mm), width (WG, mm), starch granule roundness (Round), dry matter content in the roots (DMC, %), pulp color (PulCo), and cyanogenic compounds (HCN). Images captured by light microscopy were used to determine the average phenotypic values, and these were further analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) considering mixed data (quantitative and qualitative). Significant differences between the cassava accessions for all traits measured revealed wide variability in starch granule characteristics. Four diversity groups with better fitness for the classification of cassava accessions based on PulCo were identified, in comparison with HCN. Accessions with differential starch characteristics were identified, and crossings for the generation of segregating populations in order to obtain table and industry varieties have been proposed.

TI Genome-wide identification and functional prediction of cold and/or
   drought-responsive lncRNAs in cassava
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Cold and drought stresses seriously affect cassava (Manihot esculenta) plant growth and yield. Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of diverse cellular processes in mammals and plants. To date, no systematic screening of lncRNAs under abiotic stress and their regulatory roles in cassava has been reported. In this study, we present the first reference catalog of 682 high-confidence lncRNAs based on analysis of strand-specific RNA-seq data from cassava shoot apices and young leaves under cold, drought stress and control conditions. Among them, 16 lncRNAs were identified as putative target mimics of cassava known miRNAs. Additionally, by comparing with small RNA-seq data, we found 42 lncNATs and sense gene pairs can generate nat-siRNAs. We identified 318 lncRNAs responsive to cold and/or drought stress, which were typically co-expressed concordantly or discordantly with their neighboring genes. Trans-regulatory network analysis suggested that many lncRNAs were associated with hormone signal transduction, secondary metabolites biosynthesis, and sucrose metabolism pathway. The study provides an opportunity for future computational and experimental studies to uncover the functions of lncRNAs in cassava.

TI Cassava postharvest physiological deterioration: a complex phenomenon
   involving calcium signaling, reactive oxygen species and programmed cell
   death
SO ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM
AB Postharvest physiological deterioration (PPD) of cassava (Manihot esculenta) storage roots is a complex physiological and biochemical process which involve many regulatory networks linked with specific proteins modulation and signaling transduction pathways. However, it is poorly understood regarding biological regulation, and the interactions among protein groups and signals to determine PPD syndrome in cassava storage roots. This review sheds some light on the possible molecular mechanisms involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium signaling transduction, and programmed cell death (PCD) in cassava PPD syndrome. A model for predicting crosstalk among calcium signaling, ROS and PCD is suggested to fine- tune PPD syndrome. This would clues to cassava molecular breeding to alleviate the PPD effects on the shelf- life.

AB Cassava peels are generated as waste on soils during cassava processing in many tropical countries. This work set out to isolate some microorganisms associated with cassava peel degradation and characterize amylase enzymes responsible for the degradation under some physiological conditions. A total of 30 bacteria was isolated from the peels with Bacillus species occurring the most (46.5%) and Enterobacter species (13.3%) being the next. Frequencies of fungal isolations was Rhizopus sp. (35%); Aspergillus niger (25%); Aspegillus flavus (20%) and Penicillium species (20%). Bacillus cereus, Bacillus substilis Bacillus pumillus, Aspergillus niger and Apergillus flavus were selected and screened for their abilities to produce amylase. Amylase activity was highest at day 4 for B. substilis (39.4 units/ml) and A. flavus (66.1 units/ml); at day 3 for B. cereus (55.6 units/ml) and A. niger (44.6 units/ml). While maximum amylase activity was obtained at day 6 for B. pumilus (80.2 units/ml). Optimum pH for amylases from the two fungal isolate was 6.0 (A. niger = 53.5 units/ml and A. flavus = 65.4 units/ml). While optimum pH for B. cereus (51.7 units/ ml) and B. pumilus (44.6 units/ml) was 6.5 and for B. substilis (56.1 units/ml) at pH 7.0. Amylase activities increased from 20 degrees C to 40 degrees C for amylase from Bacillus sp. and 20 degrees C to 50 degrees C for amylase from the Aspergillus sp. after which there was a decline in activities as temperature increased to 80 degrees C. Effect of heating duration (at 70 degrees C for 5 minutes) on the amylase showed that A. niger has the highest activity of 127 units/ml. Effect of substrate concentration on amylase activity showed that amylase form A. flavus had the highest activity of 72.2 units/ml at 0.4% substrate concentration. The implications of the findings were discussed.

TI Foliar nutrient and metal levels of crops in the Mount Cameroon
   area-reference values for plant nutrition and environmental monitoring
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB The growing population number and traffic loads, increasing environmental pressures, agricultural intensification, and the establishment of Mount Cameroon National Park demand farsighted environmental management in the region and the definition of a favorable ecological status. Since plants grow in the interface between soils and the atmosphere they can be used as passive biomonitors for the environmental quality. At the same time, the accumulation of nutrients and pollutants in crops is linked to human health, so that foliar elemental levels can be used as an integrative measure for environmental pollution and impact assessment. In the present study, we collected leaf samples of plantain, cassava, cocoyam, and maize on 28 sites at the southern flanks of Mt. Cameroon and determined 20 chemical elements. Air pollution in the study area comes from biomass and waste burning mainly, but emissions from traffic and a large refinery were believed to also play a significant role. However, spatial patterns in foliar elemental concentrations reflected the geochemistry rather than specific sources of pollution. Significant differences in foliar metal and nutrient levels were observed between the four species, indicating a different demand and uptake of specifyic elements. The results were compared to published data on nutrient concentrations in the tested species and the so-called reference plant. The data can be used as a baseline for future studies in plant nutrition and the environmental monitoring in inner tropical regions where these crops are grown.

TI Physical Properties of Cassava Grits before and after Pneumatic Drying
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB Particle characteristics are crucial knowledge to improve the process chain of cassava flour. Wet and dry grits, as the intermediate products, were investigated in this study. With respect to particle size, wet grits were predominately (66.7%) obtained between mesh size 0.50 and 1.00 mm, while dry grits (28.4%) were between 0.09 and 0.25 mm. Higher moisture content of wet grits generally resulted in higher bulk density, static and dynamic angle of repose, but lower particle density and porosity than dry grits. Plywood typically led to the highest coefficient of static friction of both, wet and dry grits. The transported mass and air velocity fitted well into a sigmoidal model. Due to particle size, terminal velocity of wet and dry grits ranged from 1.07 to 4.25 m/s and from 0.88 to 2.87 m/s, respectively, whereas conveying velocity ranged from 1.23 to 6.47 m/s and from 1.02 to 3.70 m/s.
   Practical ApplicationsPhysical characteristics of wet and dry cassava grits were compared and studied. Particle size distribution relies on moisture change before and after drying. Effect of particle size on the aerodynamic properties was investigated. Homogeneity of particle size before flash drying should be controlled using sieves.

TI Bioprocessing of bran with exopolysaccharide producing microorganisms as
   a tool to improve expansion and textural properties of extruded cereal
   foams with high dietary fibre content
SO LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB High dietary fibre levels, especially insoluble that is typical for cereal bran, have been associated with poor structural, textural and sensory properties in extruded products. The effect of fermentation with baker's yeast, fermentation with a mixture of Kazachstania exigua and Lactobacillus brevis with and without added hydrolytic enzymes, as well as with Weissella confusa, on the structural and textural properties of high dietary fibre extrudates (ca. 6-14 g/100 g added fibre) in extrusion was studied. Superior structural and textural extrudate characteristics were achieved by fermentation of bran with dextran producing W. confusa. At 40 g/100 g addition of W. confusa treated bran (12 g/100 g fibre content) radial expansion was the same as for the pure rye endosperm flour control, while density was 35% lower. Hardness (54.1 -> 16.3 N) and crispiness work (4.11 -> 0.45 Nmm) were reduced (P < 0.05), while the crispiness index was significantly higher (0.002 -> 0.05) than that of the control extrudate. Bioprocessing with mixed fermentation, containing K. exigua and L brevis, together with hydrolytic enzymes also improved the structural and textural characteristics of the bran in extrusion, while baker's yeast fermentation did not significantly affect these characteristics.

TI Novel process combining anaerobic-aerobic digestion and ion exchange
   resin for full recycling of cassava stillage in ethanol fermentation
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB A novel cleaner ethanol production process has been developed. Thin stillage is treated initially by anaerobic digestion followed by aerobic digestion and then further treated by chloride anion exchange resin. This allows the fully-digested and resin-treated stillage to be completely recycled for use as process water in the next ethanol fermentation batch, which eliminates wastewater discharges and minimizes consumption of fresh water. The method was evaluated at the laboratory scale. Process parameters were very similar to those found using tap water. Maximal ethanol production rate in the fully-recycled stillage was 0.9 g/L/h, which was similar to the 0.9 g/L/h found with the tap water control. The consumption of fresh water was reduced from 4.1 L/L (fresh water/ethanol) to zero. Compared with anaerobically-aerobically digested stillage which had not been treated with resin, the fermentation time was reduced by 28% (from 72 h to 52 h) and reached the level achieved with tap water. This novel process can assist in sustainable development of the ethanol industry. (C<^>)2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI CONSTRAINTS TO CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AMONG CASSAVA WOMEN FARMERS:
   IMPLICATIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL TRANSFORMATION AND FOOD SECURITY IN EBONYI
   STATE, NIGERIA
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOSYSTEMS AND ECOLOGY SCIENCE-IJEES
AB The study investigated constraints to climate change adaptation among cassava women farmers and highlighted implications for agricultural transformation and food security in Ebonyi State, Nigeria. The study described the socio-economic characteristics of cassava women farmers, ascertained major manifestations of climate change, determined constraints to women adaptation in cassava production and highlighted implications for agricultural transformation and food security in Ebonyi State, Nigeria. A total of 160 cassava women farmers randomly selected constituted the sample size for the study, while structured interview guide was employed for data collection and frequency counts and percentages, multiple regression and factor analysis techniques were employed. Results show that majority (56.9%) of the women farmers were within the ages of 31-50 years, while majority (70.0%) had SSCE/WASC/GCE O/L qualifications and majority (60.1%) reported estimated annual income of N51,000.00N150,000.00. Some of the major manifestations of climate change effects in cassava production were reported as hotness of weather (-6.611), variability in relative humidity (3.488), and frequency of flood (-2.585). Principal factors such as; lack of institutional support, inadequate socio-cultural attitude and poor managerial skill were identified as constraints to climate change adaptation in cassava production. The study highlighted implications for agricultural transformation and food security on improved extension training in farmers groups, group resources management, improved funding to extension and extension training on climate change adaptation. Effectiveness in adaptation to climate change for cassava based agricultural transformation and food security in Ebonyi State, Nigeria depends on the extent major climate change effects raised and constraints identified can be addressed and sustained. The study recommends government provision of basic infrastructure, access to cassava inputs, improved extension services on climate change adaptation and women groups' resources management.

TI Changes in Family Production Systems on the Implementation of Palm Oil
   in Eastern Amazonia
SO DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
AB In this article, we analyze the changes in family production systems throughout their productive paths, emphasizing the changes occurred due to the implementation of palm oil in these systems in Eastern Amazon. The survey was conducted in Northeastern Para (main oil palm expansion area), where 162 questionnaires were applied to family farmers integrated into palm agribusinesses and also a retrospective analysis was heldin 10 farms. As main results, five types of production systems combining palm culture with other activities, such as annual crops cultivation, agroforestry systems (SAF), black pepper and cattle, were identified. In the trajectory analysis, typology revealed three trajectory groups: 1) the trajectory of annual crops with a tendency to specialization in oil palm cultivation; 2) the trajectory of perennial (highlighting black pepper and fruit in SAF) and palm, and; 3) the trajectory of livestock and oil palm. What differentiates the trajectories are the strategies developed by each family to ensure their social reproduction through agriculture. It was concluded that the implementation of palm culture caused changes in the structure, organization and course of production systems, but the changes are not only practical, but also symbolic, because the system integration represents "modernity" to family farmers, by having all the financial and technological apparatus that traditional cultures in the region, such as cassava, do not. So for farmers this is the main alternative for development.

SO POLIMEROS-CIENCIA E TECNOLOGIA
AB This work investigated the influence of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) in thermoplastic starch/poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) films produced by blown extrusion, using different MCC contents (4, 7 and 10 g. 100 g(-1)). The films were characterised for their mechanical, structural and barrier properties. Increasing fibres concentration reduced the tensile strength (6.9 to 4.6 MPa), the elongation at break (568 to 147%) and weight loss in water (12.8 to 11.1%) of the films. The rigidity of the films increased from 19.8 MPa (without MCC) to 79.2 MPa in the samples with 10 g. 100 g(-1) of MCC. SEM images showed the occurrence of some agglomerates in this sample. The water vapour permeability of the films was not affected by the presence of MCC. The production of starch/PBAT/MCC films by blown extrusion was successful; however some adjustments are necessary to improve the dispersion of the particles at the polymeric matrix.

TI Effects of Cassava (Manihot esculenta crantz) Root Meal in Diets
   Containing Corn Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles on Production
   Performance, Egg Quality, and Excreta Noxious Gas Emission in Laying
   Hens
SO BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF POULTRY SCIENCE
AB This study was conducted to evaluate effects of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) root meal (CRM) in laying hen diets containing corn dried distiller grains with soluble (DDGS) on production performance, egg quality, and excreta noxious gas emission. Two hundred and forty Hy-Line brown laying hens (40 weeks of age) were randomly divided into 1 of 4 dietary treatments (10 replications with 6 hens per replication) for 6 weeks. The dietary treatments were as follows: 1) corn-based diet (CON); 2) diet containing 10% CRM and 8% DDGS (CRM10); 3) diet containing 20% CRM and 8% DDGS (CRM20); 4) diet containing 30% CRM and 8% DDGS (CRM30). The inclusion of 30% CRM in the diet containing 8% DDGS significantly decreased (p<0.05) average daily feed intake (ADFI), egg production, and feed conversion ratio. Increasing the level of CRM in laying hen diets did not affect (p>0.05) the egg quality with the exception of decreased (p<0.05) egg yolk color when 30% of CRM was included in laying hens diet. CRM20 and CRM30 dietary treatments tended to decrease ammonia emission compared with CON dietary treatment (p=0.08). In conclusion, the results of the current study demonstrated that CRM may be incorporated to a concentration of 20% in laying hen diets containing 8% DDGS without detrimental effects on production performance and egg quality. Furthermore, the addition of 20% and 30% CRM in laying hen diets containing 8% DDGS tended to reduce the excreta ammonia emission.

SO ORBITAL-THE ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB The inorganic components, especially magnesium, iron, copper and zinc contained in vegetable roots are of major importance, but seldom taken into account, either by general practitioners or by dietitians. The goal of this work is to report on magnesium, iron, copper and zinc in potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, yam and taro produced, and consumed in Campo Grande, the capital of Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil. After previous determination of humidity, the vegetables were digested with a mixture of HNO3 and H2O2 in the microwave digestion system Speedwave (R), Berghof, Germany. The levels of trace elements were measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES, iCap 6000 (R) Thermo Scientific, USA). Most of the elements analyzed occur at levels within the range reported from international and Brazilian sources. However, iron in common potato, sweet potato and cassava was at the lowest level, while magnesium was very low in taro samples. The bioelements studied cannot pose any serious health risks and the edible tuberous roots widely consumed in Mato Grosso do Sul may represent an important source of essential micronutrients. The data show exclusively the population exposure to these minerals, no assumptions made as to their real absorption or bioavailability.

SO PHARMACOGNOSY RESEARCH
AB Background: The chemical composition of plants used in traditional medicine exhibits biologically active compounds, such as tannins, flavonoids, and alkaloids and becomes a promising approach to treat microbial infections, mainly with drug-resistant bacteria. Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the hydroethanolic leaf extracts of Tamarindus indica (tamarind) and Manihot esculenta (cassava) as antimicrobial potential against Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolated and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Materials and Methods: Hydroethanolic leaf extracts were prepared and characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography/diode array detection, Fourier transform infrared, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, and ultraviolet-visible methods. The antimicrobial activity against four strains of clinical relevance was evaluated by the microdilution method at minimum inhibitory concentrations. Results: Phenolic compounds such as flavonoids were detected in the plant extracts. T. indica extract at 500 mu g/mL showed antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa; however, M. esculenta showed only activity against P. aeruginosa in this concentration. Conclusions: Our results suggested that polyphenols and flavonoids present in T. indica leaf extracts are a potential source of antimicrobial compound. The T. indica extract showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa while M. esculenta had effect only on P. aeruginosa meropenem resistant.

TI High genetic diversity among and within bitter manioc varieties
   cultivated in different soil types in Central Amazonia
SO GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Although manioc is well adapted to nutrient-poor Oxisols of Amazonia, ethnobotanical observations show that bitter manioc is also frequently cultivated in the highly fertile soils of the floodplains and Amazonian dark earths (ADE) along the middle Madeira River. Because different sets of varieties are grown in each soil type, and there are agronomic similarities between ADE and floodplain varieties, it was hypothesized that varieties grown in ADE and floodplain were more closely related to each other than either is to varieties grown in Oxisols. We tested this hypothesis evaluating the intra-varietal genetic diversity and the genetic relationships among manioc varieties commonly cultivated in Oxisols, ADE and floodplain soils. Genetic results did not agree with ethnobotanical expectation, since the relationships between varieties were variable and most individuals of varieties with the same vernacular name, but grown in ADE and floodplain, were distinct. Although the same vernacular name could not always be associated with genetic similarities, there is still a great amount of variation among the varieties. Many ecological and genetic processes may explain the high genetic diversity and differentiation found for bitter manioc varieties, but all contribute to the maintenance and amplification of genetic diversity within the manioc in Central Amazonia.

TI Development of a new cleaner production process for cassava ethanol
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB A new cleaner production process for cassava ethanol has been developed, in which the thin stillage by-product was treated initially by anaerobic digestion, and the digestate further processed by hydrogen-form cation exchange resin before being recycled as process water to make mash for the next ethanol fermentation batch. Thus waste water was eliminated and freshwater and energy consumption was significantly reduced. To evaluate the new process, ten consecutive batches of ethanol fermentation and anaerobic digestion at lab scale were carried out. Average ethanol production in the recycling batches was 11.43% (v/v) which was similar to the first batch, where deionized (DI) waterwas used as process water. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate reached 98% and the methane yield was 322 ml per gram of COD removed, suggesting an efficient and stable operation of the anaerobic digestion. In conclusion, the application of the new process can contribute to sustainable development of the cassava ethanol industry.

TI Electroneutral Quaternization/Sulfosuccination for Alleviating the
   Adverse Effect of Paste Aging on the Properties of Corn Starch Film
SO JOURNAL OF WUHAN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY-MATERIALS SCIENCE EDITION
AB For the purpose of alleviating the adverse effect of paste aging on the properties of corn starch film, a series of electroneutrally quaternized/sulfosuccinylated starches (EQSS) with different degrees of substitution (DS) were synthesized via the quaternization/sulfosuccination of acid-thinned corn starch (ATS) by varying the amounts of N-(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropl) trimethylammonium chloride, maleic anhydride, and sodium hydrogen sulfite. The influence of paste aging on the properties of starch film cast from heat-induced starch paste was investigated and the properties were explored in terms of tensile strength, elongation, work at break, degree of crystallinity, and flex-fatigue resistance. The experimental results showed that the paste ageing generated adverse influence on the elongation, work at break, and flex-fatigue resistance of starch film. Further experiments showed that electroneutral quaternization/sulfosuccination of starch were able to alleviate the negative effect of paste ageing on the elongation, work at break, and flex-fatigue resistance, thereby obviously enhancing the elongation, work at break and flex-fatigue resistance, and thus reducing the drawback of brittleness. The enhancement depended on the amounts of the substituents introduced. With the increase in DS value, the elongation and work at break as well as flex-fatigue resistance continuously rose, whereas the tensile strength gradually reduced.

TI Antagonistic activity of Trichoderma spp. against Scytalidium lignicola
   CMM 1098 and antioxidant enzymatic activity in cassava
SO PHYTOPARASITICA
AB Trichoderma spp. are used as antagonists against different pathogens. Despite many possibilities of using Trichoderma as an antagonist, there are gaps in the knowledge of the interaction between Trichoderma, cassava and Scytalidium lignicola. This fungus causes cassava black root rot and is an inhabitant of the soil, so it is difficult to control. Antagonists may contribute to the possible induction of resistance of plants because, when exposed to such pathosystems, plants respond by producing antioxidative enzymes. The test for potential inhibition of growth of S. lignicola CMM 1098 in vitro was performed in potato-dextrose-agar with two Trichoderma strains T. harzianum URM3086 and T. aureoviride URM 5158. We evaluated the effect of the two selected Trichoderma to reduce the severity of cassava black root rot and shoots. Subsequently, the production of enzymes (ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase) was evaluated in cassava plants. All two Trichoderma strains show an inhibition of the growth of S. lignicola CMM 1098. The most efficient was T. harzianum URM 3086, with 80.78% of mycelial growth inhibition. T. aureoviride URM 5158 was considered the best chitinase producer. All treatments were effective in reducing severity, especially treatments using Trichoderma. Cassava plants treated with T. aureoviride URM 5158 had the highest enzyme activity, especially peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase. Trichoderma harzianum URM3086 and Trichoderma aureoviride URM 5158 were effective in reducing the severity of cassava black root rot caused by S. lignicola CMM 1098.

TI Effects of different ratios and storage periods of liquid brewer's yeast
   mixed with cassava pulp on chemical composition, fermentation quality
   and in vitro ruminal fermentation
SO ASIAN-AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES
AB Objective: This study aims to evaluate the chemical composition, fermentation quality and in vitro ruminal fermentation of various ratios and storage periods of liquid brewer's yeast (LBY) mixed with cassava pulp (CVP).
   Methods: Four mixtures of fresh LBY and CVP were made (LBY0, LBY10, LBY20, and LBY30 for LBY: CVP at 0: 100, 10: 90, 20: 80, and 30: 70, respectively) on a fresh matter basis, in 500 g in plastic bags and stored at 30 to 32 degrees C. After storage, the bags were opened weekly from weeks 0 to 4. Fermentation quality and in vitro gas production (IVGP) were determined, as well as the dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and acid detergent lignin contents.
   Results: The contents of CP and EE increased, whereas all other components decreased, in proportion to LBY inclusion (p<0.01). The DM and OM contents gradually decreased in weeks 3 and 4 (p<0.05), while EE contents were lowest in week 0. The pH, ammonia nitrogen per total nitrogen (NH3-N/TN) and V-score in each mixture and storage period demonstrated superior fermentation quality (pH <= 4.2, NH3-N/TN <= 12.5%, and V-score>90%). The pH increased and NH3-N/TN decreased, with proportionate increases of LBY, whereas the pH decreased and NH3-N/TN increased, as the storage periods were extended (p<0.01). Although IVGP decreased in proportion to the amount of LBY inclusion (p<0.01), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) was unaffected by the mixture ratios. The highest IVGP and IVOMD were observed in week 0 (p<0.01).
   Conclusion: The inclusion of LBY (as high as 30%) into CVP improves the chemical composition of the mixture, thereby increasing the CP content, while decreasing IVGP, without decreasing fermentation quality and IVOMD. In addition, a preservation period of up to four weeks can guarantee superior fermentation quality in all types of mixtures. Therefore, we recommend limiting the use of CVP as a feed ingredient, given its low nutritional value and improving feed quality with the inclusion of LBY.

TI A simple hydroponic hardening system and the effect of nitrogen source
   on the acclimation of in vitro cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz)
SO IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-PLANT
AB Plant tissue culture technology is being widely used for large-scale, rapid, clonal multiplication and genetic transformation in cassava. The main limitation of this technology is the period of acclimation of the fragile in vitro plants after they have been multiplied or regenerated. Most losses of in vitro plants occur when the plantlets are moved directly from the test tubes to the ex vitro conditions. Our aim was to design a simple, rapid, low-maintenance hydroponic system to improve survival rate of transplanting to the ex vitro conditions through the rapid acclimation process of in vitro plants. In this paper, we have developed a simple hydroponic system to accelerate the cassava acclimation and multiplication process. This system considerably increased the survival percentage of in vitro and/or transgenic lines and reduces the time requirement for multiplication by hydroponic acclimation. In order to assess the effectiveness of the acclimation of seedlings on their establishment, we analyzed plant growth and field survival rate with response to different nitrogen (N) sources using different cassava accessions. Nitrogen sources of NO3- and NH4NO3 increased plant growth and root length compared to NH4+ alone, or water treatments. The greenhouse and field survivability of N-hardened plants, including transgenic lines, were significantly different in growth and development. We present a simple NO3- hydroponic acclimation system that can be quickly and cheaply constructed and used by the cassava community around the world. The efficiency of our proposed N hydroponic acclimation system is validated in the transgenic development pipeline which will enhance the cassava molecular breeding.

TI Refined cassava flour in bread making: a review
SO INGENIERIA E INVESTIGACION
AB Different studies have developed a variety of breads using cassava flour, with similar characteristics to wheat flour breads. The use of cassava flour in bread making is a convenient alternative for promoting the use of a local crop as well as reducing imports of wheat flour, promoting the production of high quality cassava flour, offering a gluten-free product and developing biofortified and fortified foods. Although the substitution level of cassava flour is limited, in some products, the incorporation of additives or flours from other crops improve the nutritional value and bread making quality of the baked foods. Several limitations have hindered the success of initiatives to promote, in some cassava producing countries, the intensive use cassava flour in bread making. Among these include the costs and efficiency of processing technologies, standards of the quality of cassava flour and lack of favorable policies. Further studies about bioavailability and retention of nutrients on baked foods and evaluation on the effects of processing cassava flour in relation to increasing the resistance starch are required to provide scientific evident for the health benefits of this flour.

TI Rationalising vitamin B-6 biofortification in crop plants
SO CURRENT OPINION IN BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Vitamin B-6 encompasses a group of related compounds (vitamers) that can only be biosynthesised de novo by plants and microorganisms. Enzymatic cofactor and antioxidant functions for vitamin B-6 are established in all kingdoms. Human vitamin B-6 dietary insufficiency or genetic defects in B-6 vitamer interconversion result in various neurological and inflammatory pathologies with several populations at-risk or marginal for vitamin B-6 status. Three (rice, wheat and cassava) of the world's top five staple crops do not meet the recommended dietary allowance for vitamin B-6, when consumed as a major proportion of the diet. In addition, controlled enhancement of the appropriate B-6 vitamer in crops has the potential to confer stress resistance. Thus, crop biofortification strategies represent an opportunity to reduce the risk of deficiency in populations with limited diet diversity and quality, as well as improving stress tolerance.

TI Folate biofortification in food crops
SO CURRENT OPINION IN BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Folates are essential vitamins in the human diet. Folate deficiency is still very common, provoking disorders such as birth defects and anemia. Biofortification via metabolic engineering is a proven powerful means to alleviate folate malnutrition. A variety of metabolic engineering approaches have been successfully implemented in different crops and tissues. Furthermore, ensuring folate stability is crucial for long-term storage of crop products. However, the current strategies, shown to be successful in rice and tomato, will need to be fine-tuned to enable adequate biofortification of other staples such as potato, wheat and cassava. Thus, there is a need to overcome remaining hurdles in folate biofortification. Overall, biofortification, via breeding or metabolic engineering, will be imperative to effectively combat folate deficiency.

TI Influence of Extrusion Cooking on In Vitro Digestibility, Physical and
   Sensory Properties of Brazilian Pine Seeds Flour (Araucaria
   Angustifolia)
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE
AB Brazilian pine seeds (pinhao) are gluten-free products derived from Araucaria angustifolia. The commercialization of these seeds is essentially associated with a low level of industrialization. In this context, extrusion cooking is a potential alternative for preparing extrudates of pinhao as a food product, which can be easily digested and is ready for human consumption. Brazilian pine seeds flour was processed in a single-screw extruder following a central composite rotatable design. Three factors (independent parameters) were considered: moisture content (14 to 22 g/100 g), screw speed (100 to 250 rpm), and temperature in the 3rd heating zone (120 to 200 degrees C). The structural characteristics, in vitro digestibility and sensory acceptance were also evaluated. The resistant starch contents is almost reduced to zero after extrusion cooking while the slowly digestible starch content is increased. An increase in moisture positively affected the hardness and the luminosity (L*), although it negatively affected the volumetric expansion index, crispness, and color parameters (a*, b*, and Delta E). The experimental conditions of this study allowed the production of expanded extrudates from Brazilian pine seeds with good expansion, texture properties, and acceptance qualities. Thus, extrusion cooking was found to be a potential method for the industrialization of Brazilian pine seeds as a food product.

TI APPLICATION OF ANTIOXIDANTS AND EDIBLE STARCH COATING TO REDUCE BROWNING
   OF MINIMALLY-PROCESSED CASSAVA
SO REVISTA CAATINGA
AB This study aimed to evaluate the quality of minimally-processed cassava treated with antioxidants and a starch-based edible coating. Cassava roots were washed, cooled, immersed in cold water, peeled and then cut. Root pieces were then immersed in a chloride solution, centrifuged, and subsequently immersed in either a starch suspension (3%), a solution containing antioxidants (3% citric acid and 3% ascorbic acid), or in both the coating and antioxidant solutions. Coated root pieces were dried at 18 +/- 2 degrees C for 1 hour, then packaged into polypropylene bags (150 g per pack) and kept at 5 +/- 2 degrees C for 15 days, and assessed every 3 days. A completely randomized design was used in a 4 x 6 factorial consisting of the treatment (control, coating, antioxidant, or coating and antioxidant) and the storage period (0, 3 6, 9, 12 or 15 days), with three replicates in each group. The pH, blackened area and peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activities of the cassava was reduced in treatments containing antioxidants and the scores of visual analysis and phenolic content were higher. Therefore, treatment with antioxidants was effective for reducing browning in minimally-processed cassava, retaining the quality of cassava pieces stored for 15 days at 5 +/- 2 degrees C. The combination of antioxidants and the edible coating showed no improvement compared to treatment with antioxidants alone.

SO BULLETIN OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) synthesized by the gel combustion technique using a bio-fuel, cassava starch (root tubers of Manihot esculenta), have been characterized by various techniques. The X-ray diffraction pattern reveals hexagonal wurtzite structure. The particle size averaged around 45 nm with an excellent band gap of 2.5 eV. The scanning electron and transmission electron microscopic images confirm the ZnO NPs to be agglomerated with loop- and chain-like morphology. The ZnO NPs prepared by this method is a promising candidate for photocatalytic hydrogen generation (41 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) under UV light illumination and (140 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) under visible light illumination.

TI Effects of biochar on enhanced nutrient use efficiency of green bean,
   Vigna radiata L.
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Biochar is the carbonized material produced from biomass and is used in several environmental applications. The biochar characteristics depend on the carbonization conditions and feedstock. The suitability of a given biochar for soil improvement depends on the biochar characteristics, soil properties, and target plants. Biochar has been applied at 1-20% (w/w) in the soil, but currently there is a lack of information on what type and concentration of biochar are most suitable for a specific plant and soil quality. Too much biochar will reduce plant growth because of the high alkalinity of biochar, which will cause long-term soil alkalinity. In contrast, too little biochar might be insufficient to enhance plant productivity. In this study, a suitable concentration of cassava stem (an abundant agricultural waste in Thailand) biochar produced at 350 degrees C was evaluated for green bean (Vigna radiata L.) growth from germination to seed production in pots over 8 weeks. The soil fertility was increased with increasing biochar concentration. At 5% (w/w) biochar, the soil fertility and plant growth were significantly enhanced, while 10% (w/w) biochar significantly enhanced bean growth and bean pod production. The increased biochar concentration in the soil significantly increased the soil total nitrogen and extractable potassium (K) levels but did not affect the amount of available phosphorous. Biochar at 10% (w/w) significantly induced the accumulation of K in the stems, leaves, nut shells, and roots but not in nut seeds. Moreover, biochar not only increased the K concentration in soil but also increased the plant nutrient use efficiency of K, which is important for plant growth.

TI MODIFYING THE SENSORY PROPERTIES OF CASSAVA STARCH VIA SIMPLIFIED
   PSEUDO-SINGLE STEP OXIDATION-ESTERIFICATION PROCESS
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION
AB The conventional two-step oxidation-esterification process has many defects due to its time-wasting, energy-consuming and quality-damping. To improve this, we developed a novel pseudo-single-step process (PSSP). In brief, to starch 400g, 600mL of sodium hypochlorite (0.7M) (1.8% of starch) was added, pH adjusted to 8.0 and left to react for 1h, then 1% acetic anhydride was added, pH adjusted to 8.0 and left to react for 3h. The finished oxidized-esterified Cassava starch (COAEC) exhibited peak-, trough-, breakdown-, final- and setback viscosities as 3,50722 cp, 1,74233 cp, 1,76544 cp, 2,64234 cp and 900 +/- 7 cp. FTIR identified the formation of carbonyl and carboxyl content. While X-ray diffractometry and differential scanning calorimetry further confirmed the destruction of microcrystalline structure. Sensory evaluation indicated COAEC had a score 5.3-5.7 compared to 4.9-5.2 of the native Cassava starch (score 7.0=like extremely).

TI PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF EXTRUDED COPOLYMER FILM
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION
AB The aim of this study was to investigate the properties of copolymer films made from cassava starch and jellyfish gelatine with glycerol or sorbitol as a plasticizer. The concentrations of gelatine used were 1 and 3% (wt/vol). The prepared copolymer of cassava starch solution (5%) and gelatine solution (1:1 (vol/vol)) was mixed with glycerol or sorbitol (30%) prior to extrusion. The feeding rate of solution was 1kg/h and the extruder screw speed was 30rpm. The films were dried by an infared dryer. All extruded films had the thickness of 0.10-0.30mm. At 1% jellyfish gelatine, the glycerol plasticized copolymer film yielded higher tensile strength, water vapor transmission rate, oxygen transmission rate and %solubility than the sorbitol plasticized film. As the concentration of jellyfish gelatine increased to 3%, the elongation of glycerol plasticized film increased approximately five times compared to two times for sorbitol plasticized films.
   practical applications Gelatine, a denatured form of collagen protein, can be derived from pig, beef or fisheries products such as fish, squid and jellyfish. The application of gelatine is widely used for food and biomedical aspect. The film copolymer of cassava starch and gelatine can be formed by a single screw extruder with glycerol or sorbitol as a plasticizer. The copolymer film with glycerol showed noticeable elongation property, which could be benefit for the development of edible film.

TI Population pressure and global markets drive a decade of forest cover
   change in Africa's Albertine Rift
SO APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB Africa's Albertine Rift region faces a juxtaposition of rapid human population growth and protected areas, making it one of the world's most vulnerable biodiversity hotspots. Using satellite-derived estimates of forest cover change, we examined national socioeconomic, demographic, agricultural production, and local demographic and geographic variables, to assess multilevel forces driving local forest cover loss and gain outside protected areas during the first decade of this century. Because the processes that drive forest cover loss and gain are expected to be different, and both are of interest, we constructed models of significant change in each direction. Although rates of forest cover change varied by country, national population change was the strongest driver of forest loss for all countries with a population doubling predicted to cause 2.06% annual cover loss, while doubling tea production predicted to cause 1.90%. The rate of forest cover gain was associated positively with increased production of the local staple crop cassava, but negatively with local population density and meat production, suggesting production drivers at multiple levels affect reforestation. We found a small but significant decrease in loss rate as distance from protected areas increased, supporting studies suggesting higher rates of landscape change near protected areas. While local population density mitigated the rate of forest cover gain, loss was also correlated with lower local population density, an apparent paradox, but consistent with findings that larger scale forces outweigh local drivers of deforestation. This implicates demographic and market forces at national and international scales as critical drivers of change, calling into question the necessary scales of forest protection policy in this biodiversity hotspot. Using a satellite derived estimate of forest cover change for both loss and gain added a dynamic component to more traditionally static and unidirectional studies, significantly improving our understanding of landscape processes and drivers at work.

TI Effects of graded levels of liquid brewer's yeast on chemical
   composition and fermentation quality in cassava pulp and rice
   straw-based total mixed ration silage
SO ANIMAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB This study aimed to evaluate the effect of liquid brewer's yeast (LBY) addition on chemical composition and fermentation quality of mixture of LBY and cassava pulp (CVP) with rice straw (RS) in different ratios during preservation periods. Four mixtures of LBY, CVP and RS were made, that is mixture ratio of LBY:CVP:RS of 0% LBY, 20% LBY, 35% LBY and 50% LBY were 0:70:30, 20:50:30, 35:35:30 and 50:20:30 as fresh matter, respectively. The bags were opened at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 after storage. The contents of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber ranged 36.4-40.0, 88.9-90.8, 4.0-12.0, 1.1-1.3, 58.8-61.6 and 37.6-40.0, respectively, and the contents of CP and EE increased and the other components decreased in proportion to LBY inclusion (P<0.01). 50% LBY had the highest (P<0.05) pH (4.81) and ammonia nitrogen per total nitrogen (NH3-N/TN) (7.40%) and the lowest V-score (90.3). Propionic and butyric acid contents were 0.01% or lower in each mixture and storage period. There were rapid pH decrease and NH3-N/TN increase during the first week of the storage period. The increases of NH3-N/TN and acetic acid content and decreases of pH, lactic acid content and V-score during the preservation were more drastic as LBY inclusion increased. Although higher proportion of LBY produced higher CP and lower fiber contents in the mixture, attention should be paid for the reduction of fermentation quality during longer storage periods.

TI Improvement of glucoamylase production for raw-starch digestion in
   Aspergillus niger F-01 by maltose stearic acid ester
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB Objectives To investigate the role of maltose stearic acid ester (MSAE) for improving raw-starch-digesting glucoamylase (RSDG) production by Aspergillus niger F-01 and its regulatory mechanism.
   Results RSDG activity was enhanced 8.3-fold by adding 5 g MSAE to 1 l basal medium at the beginning of the culture. RSDG biosynthesis nearly ceased by adding 100 mu g actinomycin D/ml or 50 mu g cycloheximide/ml in a 48 h culture in the basal medium. RSDG biosynthesis was restarted by adding MSAE in the culture repressed by actinomycin D. No revival of RSDG synthesis was observed by adding MSAE in the culture repressed by cycloheximide.
   Conclusions MSAE improved RSDG production in A. niger by inducing the transcription of RSDG.

TI Assessing consumer expectations about pizza: A study on celiac and
   non-celiac individuals using the word association technique
SO FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB The word association (WA) technique was used to investigate the perception of two groups of consumers (72 celiac and 78 non-celiac individuals; 150 in total) to pizza dough (thick or thin) and the raw material used at the manufacture (cassava flour or rice flour). Different perceptions of the four stimuli were detected by Chi-square test (X-2 = 314.393, p < 0.0001) for both groups. Seven categories were used for both groups: food/composition, health, doubt/uncertainty, novelty, negative feelings, positive feelings, and sensory aspects. The stimulus 'pizza dough made with cassava flour' was associated with the category "food/composition" and the stimuli 'pizza made with rice flour', 'pizza made with cassava flour' and 'thin dough' were associated with "positive feelings". The stimulus 'thick dough' was related only to the category "negative feelings". WA indicated that gluten-free pizza should have thin dough and us cassava flour or rice flour as the raw material.

TI Perceptual selection and the unconscious selection of 'volunteer'
   seedlings in clonally propagated crops: an example with African cassava
   (Manihot esculenta Crantz) using ethnobotany and population genetics
SO GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION
AB The role of sexual reproduction in magnifying genetic diversity in clonally propagated crops is now well documented. But whereas many studies have emphasized the importance of perceptual distinctiveness and its role in arousing farmers' curiosity towards plants with unusual morphological traits, few have considered its corollary, perceptual indistinctiveness. In this study, we investigated which factors influence farmers' behaviours towards selfsown 'volunteer' seedlings of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) in a cross-cultural survey in Gabon, Central Africa. Interviews revealed that farmers were seven times more likely to spare seedlings that resembled a named landrace compared to those that did not. Similarly, farmers were more likely to relax weeding pressures on cassava volunteers if they believed that volunteers were resurgences from old cuttings. The model fit significantly improved when cultural factors were accounted for, suggesting strong culture-dependent differences among communities in their perception of and attitudes towards cassava volunteers. An analysis of the structure of genetic diversity of cassava landrace populations at the community level showed that most landraces included singleton genotypes, even in villages where farmers imposed the strongest weeding pressures, suggesting that there is always some background incorporation of cassava seedlings. We show that by channelling the selective incorporation of cassava seedlings that are morphologically indistinguishable from familiar landraces, perceptual selection favors the recruitment, sometimes deliberate but more often unconscious, of new genotypes from plants germinating from seeds and contributes to balancing the disadvantages of strictly clonal propagation, while maintaining landraces within consensual combinations of perceptually distinct traits.

TI Nanocomposites Based on Cassava Starch and Chitosan-Modified Clay:
   Physico-Mechanical Properties and Biodegradability in Simulated Compost
   Soil
SO JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Organic-inorganic nanocomposites based on cassava starch, glycerol and chitosan-modified Veegum((R)) HS clay mineral at two different low polymer-to-clay ratios (2.5 and 5.0 wt.%) were prepared by extrusion producing flexible, transparent and homogeneous plastics as potential candidates for agricultural purposes. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy images revealed the presence of both intercalated and exfoliated nanocomposites in all samples, in which exfoliation is the predominant type of microscopic structure. Statistically significant improvements of over 20% on the tensile strength and Young's modulus were observed for samples containing chitosan-modified clay in comparison to pristine thermoplastic starch. Chitosan deeply affects the conversion of polymer carbon to CO2 through biodegradation. Mineralization values for the sample loaded with 5.0 wt.% of chitosan-modified clay in simulated compost soil showed a reduction of almost 40% in comparison to thermoplastic starch, benefiting applications where delay degradation is required.

TI Impact of pre-treatments on properties of lignocelluloses and their
   accessibility for a subsequent carboxymethylation
SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB In this issue, different chemical (alkaline and sulfite pulping, ozonolysis) and mechanical (vibratory ball milling) pre-treatments were utilized for activating wheat straw and beech sawdust prior to carboxymethylation. Detailed analysis by a range of methods, including Klason-lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose quantification, Powder-X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and attenuated total reflection (ATR) IR spectroscopy, enabled the investigation of material alterations. Subsequently, carboxymethylation was carried out with both untreated and activated materials, allowing the evaluation of activation steps by determining degrees of substitution with carboxymethyl groups (DScm). Moreover, carboxymethylation conditions were optimized, realizing high DScm of up to 1.05. Results further revealed that ball milling enhanced the subsequent conversion; whereas chemical pre-treatments did not effectively increase material accessibilities. Further studies on chemically untreated materials emphasized that a highly reactive surface was already generated in the course of the carboxymethylation, inter alia through the concomitant dissolution of matrix components.

TI Genetic diversity of farmer-preferred cassava landraces in Tanzania
   based on morphological descriptors and single nucleotide polymorphisms
SO PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES-CHARACTERIZATION AND UTILIZATION
AB Cassava germplasm collection is important for the preservation of genetic variability, allowing the development of improved cultivars with desirable traits such as drought and disease tolerance, better starch quality and yield. Therefore, the assessment of diversity in cassava germplasm maintained by farmers is important for maintaining biodiversity and crop improvement. Herein, we report genetic diversity relationships of 52 farmer-preferred cassava landraces from the eastern zone of Tanzania based on morphological descriptors and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Cluster analysis was performed for both morphological traits (genetic distance 1.18-0.15) and SNPs (genetic distance 0.078-0.002). The analysis revealed that there were a total of 17,393 variant positions, and that several of the SNPs were distributed across all the chromosomes. The abundance of SNP varied remarkably among the 18 cassava chromosomes, with chromosome 2 having the highest number of SNPs (1335) and chromosome 18 having the lowest number of SNPs (734). The power of SNPs in distinguishing morphologically similar landraces was shown. Both analyses did not group landraces according to geographical locations, suggesting that farmers were moving cassava germplasm to different areas. Their diversity was mainly due to adaptation and preferential selection by farmers. This further implied that within a geographical location, the cultivars were more diverse and there was no misnaming of cassava cultivars by farmers. The collection revealed a wide range of genetic diversity, and represented a valuable resource for trait improvement, allowing the capture of farmer-preferred traits in future cassava breeding programmes.

TI Physical property testing of a novel hybrid natural rubber-graft-cassava
   starch/sodium alginate bead for encapsulating herbicide
SO POLYMER TESTING
AB A novel bead of modified starch for encapsulating 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetate (2,4 DA) was made from natural rubber -graft -cassava starch (NS) and sodium alginate (SA) in a water -based system. The particle size and zeta potential of pristine NS, the NS/SA blend and the NS/SA blend containing 2,4 DA were evaluated. The swelling ratio in water of the beads was investigated and found to be enhanced as a function of the SA portion in the hydrogel due to an increase in the hydrophilic groups in the beads. In addition, the chemical interaction between 2,4 DA and the polymer matrix was investigated by FTIR and XRD. The results suggest that an NS/SA matrix is a good polymer membrane for encapsulating 2,4 DA in a water medium and the beads are also easily decomposed in the natural environment after use.

TI Pasting and thermal properties of waxy corn starch modified by
   1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB Waxy corn starch was modified with the 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme (GBE) from Geobacillus thermoglucosidans STBO2. Incubating waxy corn starch with GBE increased the number of alpha-1,6 branch points and reduced the average chain length. Enzymatic modification also decreased the breakdown and setback values of Brabender viscosity curves, indicating that the modified starch had higher paste stability. Pre-heating the starch at 65 degrees C for 30 min before incubation with GBE could promote enzymatic modification of starch. Linear regression was used to describe the relationships between starch structure and its pasting and thermal properties. The setback value showed a negative linear correlation with the alpha-1,6 branch point content (R-2 = 0.9824) and a positive linear correlation with the average chain length (R-2 = 0.8954). Meanwhile, the gelatinization enthalpy was also linearly correlated to the alpha-1,6 branch point content (R-2 = 0.9326) and the average chain length (R-2 = 0.8567). These insights provide a useful reference for food processors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Impact of insecticides on spiralling whitefly, Aleurodicus dispersus
   (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) and its natural enemy complex in cassava under
   open field conditions
SO CROP PROTECTION
AB Although insecticides can be used to control pests on cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz.) they could have detrimental effects on natural enemies. Nine important insecticides, thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, buprofezin, acetamiprid, spiromesifen, triazophos, acephate, thiodicarb and thiacloprid, were selected to test their efficacy against spiralling whitefly, Aleurodicus dispersus (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) to clarify selectivity of these insecticides on its natural enemies. All insecticides caused substantial reduction in spiralling whitefly populations on cassava during two seasons. Acephate and triazophos were effective in controlling the spiralling whitefly population (>90% reduction in both seasons) on cassava and recorded higher tuber yield than other insecticidal treatments during both the seasons. All insecticides significantly reduced the emergence of parasitoids (Encarsia guadeloupae Viggiani and Encarsia meritoria Gahan) and percent parasitism (<1%) when compared with the control. However, buprofezin was relatively less toxic to Cybocephalus spp. and Mallada astur (Banks) than other insecticides. To summarize, buprofezin can be included in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs since it was comparatively effective in controlling of A. dispersus (>75% reduction in both seasons) and relatively less toxic to Cybocephalus spp. and M. astur which are the major predators of spiralling whitefly in cassava.

TI Rapid differentiation among Lactobacillus, Pediococcus and Weissella
   species from some Nigerian indigenous fermented foods
SO LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The taxonomic differentiation among lactic acid bacteria (LAB) using only phenotypic methods is inadequate. In the past, several phenotypic techniques have been applied in identification of different species of LAB from Nigerian indigenous fermented foods. In this study, two less-expensive and rapid molecular techniques were employed in the identification and differentiation of LAB species isolated from some Nigerian fermented foods: gari (cassava mash), fufu (cassava dough) and ogi (maize gruel) to avoid the common errors that are synonymous with the use of conventional methods. The size of the amplified products for the LAB species using universal primers fD1 and rD1 was about 1500 bp. The differentiation of the three predominant LAB, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Weissella confusa to species level was performed by intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS-PCR) and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) using three restriction endonucleases: HinfI, HaeIII and RsaI. In summary, the study demonstrated that the ARDRA and ITS-PCR analysis are simple, fast and efficient methods that can be used for the routine identification and rapid differentiation of LAB species which are often regularly used as probiotics, starter culture and biopreservative in fermented foods consumed since they are generally regarded as safe (GRAS).

AB Biodegradable films based on red rice flour (RRF) and red rice starch (RRS) with glycerol as plasticizer were developed and formulated with different RRF:RRS ratios (10:0, 9:1, 7:3, 5:5, and 0:10, w/w). The mechanical, physicochemical, barrier, optical, antioxidant, and biodegradability properties were evaluated. The morphology, thermal stability, and protective effect of the films against sunflower oil oxidation were investigated only for selected films. The films had interesting results for moisture content, solubility, water holding capacity, water vapor permeability, color, and light transmission. Among the films studied, RRF-RRS (9:1) film showed improved mechanical properties and lower cost compared with rice starch -based film. The films exhibited great activity in scavenging the DPPH radical (>90%). Regarding biodegradability, all films lost around 60% of weight after 15 days in soil degradation analysis. The selected RRF-RRS films (10:0, 9:1, and 0:10) were thermally stable until approximately 150 degrees C. SEM analyses revealed that flour-based films have less smooth surfaces and that the incorporation of starch improved their homogeneity. The RRF-RRS (9:1) film exhibited an interesting protective effect of sunflower oil and retarded its oxidation process. Therefore, this study suggests that red rice flour and starch are promising raw materials with potential to be used as active food packaging. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Proteomic analysis of injured storage roots in cassava (Manihot

SO PLOS ONE
AB Postharvest physiological deterioration (PPD) is a global challenge in the improvement of cassava value chain. However, how to reduce cassava spoilage and reveal the mechanism of injured cassava storage roots in response to PPD were poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the activities of antioxidant enzymes of cassava injured storage roots in PPD-susceptible (SC9) and PPD-tolerant (QZ1) genotypes at the time-points from 0h to 120h, and further analyzed their proteomic changes using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) in combination with MALDI-TOF-MS/MS. Ninety-nine differentially expressed proteins were identified from SC9 and QZ1 genotypes in the pairwise comparison of 24h/0h, 48h/0h, 72h/0h and 96h/0h. Of those proteins were associated with 13 biological functions, in which carbohydrate and energy metabolism related proteins were the biggest amount differential proteins in both genotypes, followed by chaperones, DNA and RNA metabolism, and defense system. We speculated that SOD in combination with CAT activities would be the first line of defense against PPD to support PPD-tolerant cassava varieties. The four hub proteins including CPN60B, LOS2, HSC70-1 and CPN20B, produced from the network of protein-protein interaction, will be the candidate key proteins linked with PPD. This study provides a new clue to improve cassava PPD-tolerant varieties and would be helpful to much better understand the molecular mechanism of PPD of cassava injured storage roots.

TI The Search for Resistance to Cassava Mosaic Geminiviruses: How Much We
   Have Accomplished, and What Lies Ahead
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB The cassava mosaic disease (CMD), which occurs in all cassava growing regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent, is caused by cassava mosaic geminiviruses (CMGs). CMGs are considered to be the most damaging vector-borne plant pathogens. So far, the most successful approach used to control these viruses has been the transfer of a polygenic recessive resistance locus, designated CMD1, from wild cassava to cassava cultivars. Further progress in harnessing natural resistance to contain CMGs has come from the discovery of the dominant monogenic resistance locus, CMD2, in some West African cassava cultivars. CMD2 has been combined with CMD1 through genetic crosses. Because of the limitations of the cassava breeding approach, especially with regard to time required to produce a variety and the loss of preferred agronomic attributes, efforts have been directed toward the deployment of genetic engineering approaches. Most of these approaches have been centered on RNA silencing strategies, developed mainly in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana. Early RNA silencing platforms assessed for CMG resistance have been use of viral genes for co-suppression, antisense suppression or for hairpin RNAs-mediated gene silencing. Here, progress and challenges in the deployment of these approaches in the control of CMGs are discussed. Novel functional genomics approaches with potential to overcome some of the drawbacks of the current strategies are also discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The continent of Africa has the highest prevalence of hunger and poverty in the world. In this paper, an Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model combined with a Crop Choice Decision Model (CCDM) is applied to simulate the production and spatial distribution of rice, wheat, millet, maize, sorghum and cassava in Africa from 1993 to 2012 converted into calories. From this, we calculate the size of the undernourished population according to the Average Dietary Energy Requirement index of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and study the trends experienced in different countries. The results show that (1) the distribution of different crops has a horizontal zonality from north to south; (2) although the distribution of different crops in Africa did not change significantly from 1993 to 2012, the total crop planting area declined, especially in the middle part of Africa; (3) the undernourished population has increased, while the proportion of undernourished people decreased; and (4) land tenure reform and international food aid has made a great contribution to improved food security in Africa. A GIS-based EPIC (GEPIC) model combined with a CCDM can enable the spatial explicit assessment of food security and the microscopic study of food security on large scale, providing more accurate decision-making information for policy makers.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Effects of tillage options on soil physical properties and
   cassava-dry-matter partitioning
SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB Conservation tillage is efficient at reducing soil degradation, but affects soil physical properties, and leads to soil compaction, negatively impacting root production, and so it is rarely adopted by cassava cultivators. The objective of this study was to evaluate the dry-matter partitioning (DMP) during a full cassava season under different tillage methods. The effects of minimum tillage (MT), conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) on soil water content, soil penetration resistance, macroporosity, microporosity and total porosity were evaluated at 70, 120, 230, 300 and 350 days after planting (DAP). Additionally, the DMP in cassava plants was evaluated every 30 days until 360 DAP at Botucatu, Brazil on an Alfisol soil. Our result revealed that the tillage type affected soil penetration resistance, macroporosity and total porosity as well as the dry matter content (DMC) on cassava leaf, stem, root and planted cutting. No significant difference was observed in total DMC. However, DMP differed significantly between 150 and 210 DAP, corresponding respectively to the root-thickening phase end and the dormancy phase beginning. The highest DMC of stem and planted cutting was observed in NT-developed plants. Shoot DMC was positively correlated with soil penetration resistance. CT and MT did not differ in root yield; hence, MT should be adopted instead of CT, as an effort to control soil erosion. NT increases the soil penetration resistance, and results in greater accumulation of DM in the stem and planted cutting than in the roots. Data suggest that increased soil penetration resistance under NT can decrease cassava root growth and induce the stem and planted cutting to play the role of storage organs.

TI Dynamical-statistical projections of the climate change impact on
   agricultural production in Benin by means of a cross-validated linear
   model combined with Bayesian statistics
SO AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB West Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change and a robust quantification of the societal impacts of climate change is essential to guide the necessary adaptation efforts. Here, we project the potential impacts of climate change on nine important crops using climate change information from a gridded observational data set and a high-resolution regional climate model driven with and without land use changes. Probabilistic crop models are developed and forced with climate predictors until 2050. It is found that large-scale climate predictors are sufficiently robust for crop modelling in the absence of reliable local climate information. Pineapple, maize, groundnuts, cassava and cowpeas will face harmful effects with an average yield reduction in the range of 11%-33% by 2050, whereas sorghum, yam, cotton and rice will benefit from climate change with an average yield gain of 10-39%. Temperature increase rather than precipitation change is responsible for the projected yield changes. Our study also shows that land cover degradation in West Africa tends to reduce yield for most crops whilst favouring the production of yam and cotton. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The potential distribution of cassava mealybug (Phenacoccus manihoti), a
   threat to food security for the poor
SO PLOS ONE
AB The cassava mealybug is a clear and present threat to the food security and livelihoods of some of the world's most impoverished citizens. Niche models, such as CLIMEX, are useful tools to indicate where and when such threats may extend, and can assist with planning for biosecurity and the management of pest invasions. They can also contribute to bioeconomic analyses that underpin the allocation of resources to alleviate poverty. Because species can invade and establish in areas with climates that are different from those that are found in their native range, it is essential to define robust range-limiting mechanisms in niche models. To avoid spurious results when applied to novel climates, it is necessary to employ cross-validation techniques spanning different knowledge domains (e.g., distribution data, experimental results, phenological observations). We build upon and update a CLIMEX niche model by Parsa et al. (PloS ONE 7: e47675), correcting inconsistent parameters and re-fitting it based on a careful examination of geographical distribution data and relevant literature. Further, we consider the role of irrigation, the known distribution of cassava production and a targeted review of satellite imagery to refine, validate and interpret our model and results. In so doing, we bring new insights into the potential spread of this invasive insect, enabling us to identify potential bio-security threats and biological control opportunities. The fit of the revised model is improved, particularly in relation to the wet and dry limits to establishment, and the parameter values are biologically plausible and accord with published scientific literature.

TI Highly efficient mesophyll protoplast isolation and PEG-mediated
   transient gene expression for rapid and large-scale gene
   characterization in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz)
SO BMC BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Background: Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a major crop extensively cultivated in the tropics as both an important source of calories and a promising source for biofuel production. Although stable gene expression have been used for transgenic breeding and gene function study, a quick, easy and large-scale transformation platform has been in urgent need for gene functional characterization, especially after the cassava full genome was sequenced.
   Methods: Fully expanded leaves from in vitro plantlets of Manihot esculenta were used to optimize the concentrations of cellulase R-10 and macerozyme R-10 for obtaining protoplasts with the highest yield and viability. Then, the optimum conditions (PEG4000 concentration and transfection time) were determined for cassava protoplast transient gene expression. In addition, the reliability of the established protocol was confirmed for subcellular protein localization.
   Results: In this work we optimized the main influencing factors and developed an efficient mesophyll protoplast isolation and PEG-mediated transient gene expression in cassava. The suitable enzyme digestion system was established with the combination of 1.6% cellulase R-10 and 0.8% macerozyme R-10 for 16 h of digestion in the dark at 25 degrees C, resulting in the high yield (4.4 x 10(7) protoplasts/g FW) and vitality (92.6%) of mesophyll protoplasts. The maximum transfection efficiency (70.8%) was obtained with the incubation of the protoplasts/vector DNA mixture with 25% PEG4000 for 10 min. We validated the applicability of the system for studying the subcellular localization of MeSTP7 (an H+/monosaccharide cotransporter) with our transient expression protocol and a heterologous Arabidopsis transient gene expression system.
   Conclusion: We optimized the main influencing factors and developed an efficient mesophyll protoplast isolation and transient gene expression in cassava, which will facilitate large-scale characterization of genes and pathways in cassava.

TI Functional Characterization of CsBGlu12, a beta-Glucosidase from Crocus
   sativus, Provides Insights into Its Role in Abiotic Stress through
   Accumulation of Antioxidant Flavonols
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Glycosylation and deglycosylation are impressive mechanisms that allow plants to regulate the biological activity of an array of secondary metabolites. Although glycosylation improves solubility and renders the metabolites suitable for transport and sequestration, deglycosylation activates them to carry out biological functions. Herein, we report the functional characterization of CsBGlu12, a beta-glucosidase from Crocus sativus. CsBGlu12 has a characteristic glucoside hydrolase 1 family (alpha/beta) 8 triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel structure with a highly conserved active site. In vitro enzyme activity revealed that CsBGlu12 catalyzes the hydrolysis of flavonol beta-glucosides and cello-oligosaccharides. Site-directed mutagenesis of any of the two conserved catalytic glutamic acid residues (Glu(200) and Glu(414)) of the active site completely abolishes the beta-glucosidase activity. Transcript analysis revealed that Csbglu12 is highly induced in response to UV-B, dehydration, NaCl, methyl jasmonate, and abscisic acid treatments indicating its possible role in plant stress response. Transient overexpression of CsBGlu12 leads to the accumulation of antioxidant flavonols in Nicotiana benthamiana and confers tolerance to abiotic stresses. Antioxidant assays indicated that accumulation of flavonols alleviated the accretion of reactive oxygen species during abiotic stress conditions. beta-Glucosidases are known to play a role in abiotic stresses, particularly dehydration through abscisic acid; however, their role through accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging flavonols has not been established. Furthermore, only one beta-glucosidase 12 homolog has been characterized so far. Therefore, this work presents an important report on characterization of CsBGlu12 and its role in abiotic stress through ROS scavenging.

TI A rapid virus- induced gene silencing (VIGS) method for assessing
   resistance and susceptibility to cassava mosaic disease
SO VIROLOGY JOURNAL
AB Background: Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is a major constraint to cassava production in sub- Saharan Africa. Under field conditions, evaluation for resistance to CMD takes 12- 18 months, often conducted across multiple years and locations under pressure from whitefly-mediated transmission. Under greenhouse or laboratory settings, evaluation for resistance or susceptibility to CMD involves transmission of the causal viruses from an infected source to healthy plants through grafting, or by using Agrobacterium- mediated or biolistic delivery of infectious clones. Following inoculation, visual assessment for CMD symptom development and recovery requires 12- 22 weeks. Here we report a rapid screening system for determining resistance and susceptibility to CMD based on virus- induced gene silencing (VIGS) of an endogenous cassava gene.
   Results: A VIGS vector was developed based on an infectious clone of the virulent strain of East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV- K201). A sequence from the cassava (Manihot esculenta) ortholog of Arabidopsis SPINDLY (SPY) was cloned into the CP position of the DNA- A genomic component and used to inoculate cassava plants by Helios r Gene Gun microparticle bombardment. Silencing of Manihot esculenta SPY (MeSPY) using MeSPY1- VIGS resulted in shoot- tip necrosis followed by death of the whole plant in CMD susceptible cassava plants within 2- 4 weeks. CMD resistant cultivars were not affected and remained healthy after challenge with MeSPY1- VIGS. Significantly higher virus titers were detected in CMD- susceptible cassava lines compared to resistant controls and were correlated with a concomitant reduction in MeSPY expression in susceptible plants.
   Conclusions: A rapid VIGS- based screening system was developed for assessing resistance and susceptibility to CMD. The method is space and resource efficient, reducing the time required to perform CMD screening to as little as 2- 4 weeks. It can be employed as a high throughput rapid screening system to assess new cassava cultivars and for screening transgenic, gene edited and breeding lines under controlled growth conditions.

TI Treating leishmaniasis in Amazonia: A review of ethnomedicinal concepts
   and pharmaco-chemical analysis of traditional treatments to inspire
   modern phytotherapies
SO JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis are neglected tropical diseases that occur in all intertropical regions of the world. Amazonian populations have developed an abundant knowledge of the disease and its remedies. Therefore, we undertook to review traditional antileishmanial plants in Amazonia and have developed new tools to analyze this somewhat dispersed information.
   Material and methods: A literature review of traditional remedies for cutaneous/mucocutaneous leishmaniasis in the Amazon was conducted and the data obtained was used to calculate distribution indexes designed to highlight the most relevant uses in Amazonia. The cultural distribution index represents the distribution rate of a given taxon among different cultural groups and was calculated as the ratio of the number of groups using the taxon to the total number of groups cited. The geographical distribution index allowed us to quantify spatial distribution of a taxon's uses in Amazonia and was calculated geometrically by measuring the average distance between the points where uses have been reported and the barycenter of those points. The general distribution index was defined as an arithmetic combination of the previous two and provides information on both cultural and spatial criteria.
   Results: 475 use reports, concerning 291 botanical species belonging to 83 families have been gathered depicted from 29 sources. Uses concern 34 cultural groups. While the use of some taxa appears to be Pan Amazonian, some others are clearly restricted to small geographical regions. Particular attention has been paid to the recipes and beliefs surrounding treatments. Topical application of the remedies dominated the other means of administration and this deserves particular attention as the main treatments against Neotropical leishmaniasis are painful systemic injections. The data set was analyzed using the previously defined distribution indexes and the most relevant taxa were further discussed from a phytochemical and pharmacological point of view.
   Conclusions: The Amazonian biodiversity and cultural heritage host a fantastic amount of data whose systematic investigation should allow a better large-scale understanding of the dynamics of traditional therapies and the consequent discovery of therapeutic solutions for neglected diseases. Distribution indices are indeed powerful tools for emphasizing the most relevant treatments against a given disease and should be very useful in the meta-analysis of other regional pharmacopeia. This focus on renowned remedies that have not yet benefitted from extended laboratory studies, could stimulate future research on new treatments of natural origin for leishmaniasis.

TI Origin and evolution of transporter substrate specificity within the NPF
   family
SO ELIFE
AB Despite vast diversity in metabolites and the matching substrate specificity of their transporters, little is known about how evolution of transporter substrate specificities is linked to emergence of substrates via evolution of biosynthetic pathways. Transporter specificity towards the recently evolved glucosinolates characteristic of Brassicales is shown to evolve prior to emergence of glucosinolate biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that glucosinolate transporters belonging to the ubiquitous NRT1/PTR FAMILY (NPF) likely evolved from transporters of the ancestral cyanogenic glucosides found across more than 2500 species outside of the Brassicales. Biochemical characterization of orthologs along the phylogenetic lineage from cassava to A. thaliana, suggests that alterations in the electrogenicity of the transporters accompanied changes in substrate specificity. Linking the evolutionary path of transporter substrate specificities to that of the biosynthetic pathways, exemplify how transporter substrate specificities originate and evolve as new biosynthesis pathways emerge.

TI Effects of Cellulose Nanofibers Filling and Palmitic Acid Emulsions
   Coating on the Physical Properties of Fish Gelatin Films
SO FOOD BIOPHYSICS
AB In this preliminary study, fish gelatin films with improved strength and water resistance were prepared from a dispersion of fish gelatin and carboxylated cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) by using the casting method, followed by subsequent coating with palmitic acid emulsion. The surface topography displayed a uniform distribution of the CNF particles in the gelatin films, but aggregation occurred at a CNF dosage of 4 wt% or higher. Due to the reinforcing effect of CNF, a dosage-dependent increase in the Young's modulus and tensile strength was observed for the CNF-reinforced films. The addition of CNF also led to an obvious increase in thermal stability. Via surface coating, the emulsion at the 60:40 (w/w) ratio of palmitic acid to water showed excellent layer-forming and high adhesion properties, contributing to the significant improvement of water resistance. The enhanced properties of these fish gelatin films would promote their practical applications in edible packaging.

TI Cold Plasma: an Alternative Technology for the Starch Modification
SO FOOD BIOPHYSICS
AB Cold plasma is an emerging novel non-thermal technology in the sector of food processing. In the present review we will discuss the recent scientific reports on properties of cold plasma treated starches. For industrial use native starch is subject to modification to enhance the properties. This paper reviews on the mechanism of starch modification by plasma reactive species, briefly discussing its effects on properties. The effect of cold plasma on starches depends on the type of feed gas, voltage applied and treatment time. The alteration in the properties is mainly due to depolymerization and cross linking of amylose and amylopectin side chains. After plasma treatment there is decrease in molecular weight, viscosity, and gelatinization temperatures. Plasma etching increased the surface energy and enhanced the hydrophilicity of the starch granules. We can conclude that cold plasma is as alternative technology to modify the properties of starch.

TI Cassava starch-based nanocomposites reinforced with cellulose nanofibers
   extracted from sisal
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB Cellulose nanofibers were extracted from sisal and incorporated at different concentrations (0-5%) into cassava starch to produce nanocomposites. Films' morphology, thickness, transparency, swelling degree in water, water vapor permeability (WVP) as well as thermal and mechanical properties were studied. Cellulose nanofiber addition affected neither thickness (56.637 +/- 2.939 mu m) nor transparency (2.97 +/- 1.07 mm(-1)). WVP was reduced until a cellulose nanofiber content of 3.44%. Tensile force was increased up to a nanocellulose concentration of 3.25%. Elongation was decreased linearly upon cellulose nanofiber addition. Among all films, the greatest Young's modulus was 2.2 GPa. Cellulose nanofibers were found to reduce the onset temperature of thermal degradation, although melting temperature and enthalpy were higher for the nanocomposites. Because cellulose nanofibers were able to improve key properties of the films, the results obtained here can pave the route for the development and large-scale production of novel biodegradable packaging materials.

TI Identification and expression analyses of new potential regulators of
   xylem development and cambium activity in cassava (Manihot esculenta)
SO PLANTA
AB We have identified new potential regulators of xylem cell-type determination and cellular proliferation in cassava and studied their expression in roots. Results are highly relevant for cassava biotechnology.
   Cassava's root system is composed of two types of root that coexist in every individual: the fibrous and the storage roots. Whether a root becomes fibrous or storage depends on the xylem cell types that it develops: fibrous roots develop xylem fibres and vessels while storage roots develop parenchyma xylem, the starch-storing tissue. A crucial question in cassava root development is how the specific xylem cell types differentiate and proliferate in the fibrous and storage roots. Using phylogenetic, protein sequence and synteny analyses we identified (1) MeVND6, MeVND7.1, MeVND7.2, MeNST3.1 and MeNST3.2 as the potential cassava orthologues of the Arabidopsis regulators of xylem cell type determination AtVND6, AtVND7 and AtNST3; and (2) MeWOX4.1 and MeWOX4.2 as the potential cassava orthologues of the Arabidopsis cambium regulator AtWOX4. Fibrous and storage roots were anatomically characterised and tested for the expression of the identified genes. Results revealed that (1) MeVND7.1 and MeVND7.2 are expressed in the fibrous but not in the storage roots; (2) MeVND6 shows low expression in both root types; (3) MeNST3.1 is not expressed in the fibrous or storage roots, while MeNST3.2 is highly expressed in both root-types and (4) MeWOX4.1 and, to a higher level, MeWOX4.2 are expressed in both the fibrous and storage roots. Results open new avenues for research in cassava root development and for food security-oriented biotechnology programmes.

Thermoplastic cassava starch (TPCS)/SD composites were also prepared and reinforced by different SD contents and compared with the TPACS/SD composites. Morphological, thermal, and biodegradable properties of different composites were also examined. The results showed that IR absorption bands of OH stretching and OH bending vibrations shifted to lower wavenumbers, indicating new hydrogen bond formation for all composites. Stress at maximum load and Young's modulus were significantly improved when the SD content increased for all the TPACS/SD and TPCS/SD composites; strain at maximum load was higher for the TPACS/SD composites. A decrease in water uptake was detected when the SD reinforcement was incorporated into either the TPACS or TPCS matrix.

AB The ethanol fermentation of enzymatically obtained bitter cassava (Manihot glaziovii) and sweet cassava (Mani hot esculenta Crantz) starches hydrolyzates by the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process using Saccharomyces cerrevisiae were studied. Granular starch hydrolysing enzyme (GSHE) was used in the process of hydrolysis to degrade starch into reducing sugar at 30 degrees C and pH 4. The concentration of starch was 200 g/L, concentration of enzyme were 1 and 2% (w/w), while the concentration of yeast was 1% at pH 4.5. The cyanide content in tuber cassava affected the ethanol production. The concentration of ethanol which produced from sweet cassava starch (42 ppm of cyanide) higher than bitter cassava starch (168 ppm of cyanide). Indeed, the cyanide decreased the activity of the enzyme. The optimum condition of the process was fermentation using concentration of substrate 200 g/L, concentration enzyme 2% (w/w), pH 4.5 and 30 C, for 60 h. It was found that ethanol 71.84 g/L (sweet cassava) and 68.65 g/L (bitter cassava) and the maximum productivity of ethanol (Q(eth)) were 2.24 gL(-1) h(-1) (sweet cassava) and 1.97 gL(-1) h(-1) (bitter cassava). Initial reducing sugar concentration for ethanol production was 34.8 g/L, while a maximum ethanol concentration (over 50 g/L) was achieved during fermentation 60 h.

TI Feed additive production by fermentation of herb Polygonum hydropiper L.
   and cassava pulp with simultaneous flavonoid dissolution
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY AND APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Fermentation of herb Polygonum hydropiper L. (PHL) and cassava pulp (CP) for feed additive production with simultaneous flavonoid dissolution was investigated, and a two-stage response surface methodology (RSM) based on Plackett-Burman factorial design (PB design) was used to optimize the flavonoid dissolution and protein content. Using the screening function of PB design, four different significant factors for the two response variables were acquired: factors A (CP) and B (PHL) for the flavonoid dissolution versus factors G (inoculum size) and H (fermentation time) for protein content. Then, two RSMs were used sequentially to improve the values of the two response variables separately. The mutual corroboration of the experimental results in the present study confirmed the validity of the associated experimental design. The validation experiment showed a flavonoid dissolution rate of 94.00%, and a protein content of 18.20%, gaining an increase in 21.20% and 199.10% over the control, respectively. The present study confirms the feasibility of feed additive production by Saccharomyces cerevisiae with CP and PHL and simultaneous optimization of flavonoid dissolution and protein content using a two-stage RSM.

TI Increased activities of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase enhance
   cassava resistance to Tetranychus urticae
SO EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY
AB In order to study the function of peroxidase (POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) in cassava resistance to spider mites, we tested the changes of transcription levels and activities of these two protective enzymes in both cassava and Tetranychus urticae (=T. cinnabarinus) during the interaction. The results showed that after damage of the mite-susceptible cassava cultivar BRA900 by T. urticae for 1 and 8 days, the transcription levels of MePOD and MePPO and the activities of POD and PPO showed no significant difference compared with those in undamaged leaves. However, the corresponding transcription levels and activities in 1- and 8-day-damaged leaves of mite-resistant cassava cultivar C1115 increased to a significant level of approximately twofold. When T. urticae fed on BRA900 for 1 and 8 days, the transcription levels of TcPPO and TcPOD and the activities of PPO and POD showed no significant difference compared with those before feeding. However, the corresponding transcription levels and activities of these two protective enzymes in T. urticae feeding on C1115 significantly decreased by about half. This study preliminarily validates the function of POD and PPO in cassava resistance to T. urticae, and provides candidate gene resource for molecular breeding of spider mite-resistant cassava.

TI Toughened cyanoethyl starch by blending with poly(methyl
   acrylate-co-acrylic acid-co-acrylonitrile) latex for warp sizing
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF FIBRE & TEXTILE RESEARCH
AB The effect of an emulsion-copolymerized poly(methyl acrylate-co-acrylic acid-co-acrylonitrile) latex on the toughening of cyanoethyl starch (CES) has been studied through blending to reduce the brittleness of CES film for warp sizing. The toughening has been accessed in terms of breaking elongation, tensile strength, work-at-break, and bending endurance of CES film. Also, the influences of the latex on the adhesion-to-fibre, desizability, and aerobic biodegradation of CES have been examined. The results show that the latex is able to toughen CES film and this action depends strongly on its blending ratio. With the increases in ratio, the breaking elongation, work-at-break, and bending endurance of the film increase gradually, whereas tensile strength of the film decreases slowly. In addition, blending the latex with CES favors the adhesion of CES to cotton and polyester fibres. It has also been found that the latex/CES blends are desizable and aerobic degradable. Suitable blending ratio in warp sizing is found in a range of 12-16 % by weight.

AB Using a matched case-control design, we sought to determine whether the odds of konzo, a distinct spastic paraparesis associated with food (cassava) cyanogenic exposure in the tropics, were associated with lower cyanide detoxification rates (CDR) and malnutrition. Children with konzo (N = 122, 5-17 years of age) were age- and sex-matched with presumably healthy controls (N = 87) and assessed for motor and cognition performances, cyanogenic exposure, nutritional status, and cyanide detoxification rates (CDR). Cyanogenic exposure was ascertained by thiocyanate (SCN) concentrations in plasma (P-SCN) and urine (U-SCN). Children with a height-for-age z-score (HAZNCHS) <-2 were classified as nutritionally stunted. CDR was measured as time required to convert cyanide to SCN, and expressed as ms/mu mol SCN/mg protein or as mmolSCN/ml plasma/min. Mean (SD) U-SCN in children with konzo was 521.9 (353.6) mu mol/l and was, significantly higher than 384.6 (223.7) mu mol/l in those without konzo. Conditional regression analysis of data for age- and sex-matched case-control pairs showed that konzo was associated with stunting (OR: 5.8; 95% CI: 2.7-12.8; p < 0.01; N = 83 paired groups) and higher U-SCN (OR: 1.1; 95% CI: 1.02-1.20 per 50-mu mol increase in U-SCN; p = 0.02; N = 47 paired groups). After adjusting for stunting and U-SCN, the odds of developing konzo was reduced by 63% (95% CI: 11-85%, p = 0.03; N = 41 paired groups) for each 5 mmol SCN/(ml plasma min)-increase in CDR. Linear regression analysis indicated a significant association between BOT-2 or KABC-II scores and both the HAZNCHS z-score and the U-SCN concentration, but not the CDR. Our findings provide evidence in support of interventions to remove cyanogenic compounds from cassava prior to human consumption or, peharps, enhance the detoxification of cyanide in those relying on the cassava as the main source of food.

TI Raising Crop Productivity in Africa through Intensification
SO AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB The population of Africa will double in the next 33 years to reach 2.5 billion by 2050. Although roughly 60% of the continent's population is engaged in agriculture, the produce from this sector cannot feed its citizens. Hence, in 2013 alone, Africa imported 56.5 million tons of wheat, maize, and soybean at the cost of 18.8 billion USD. Although crops cultivated in Africa play a vital role in their contribution to Food Security, they produce inferior yields compared to those in other parts of the world. For instance, the average cereal yield in Africa is only 1.6 t ha(-1) compared to the global 3.9 t ha(-1). Low productivity in Africa is also related to poor soil fertility and scarce moisture, as well as a variety of insect pests, diseases, and weeds. While moisture scarcity is responsible for up to 60% of yield losses in some African staple cereals, insect pests inflict annually substantial crop losses. In order to devise a strategy towards boosting crop productivity on the continent where food insecurity is most prevalent, these production constraints should be investigated and properly addressed. This review focuses on conventional (also known as genetic) intensification in which crop productivity is raised through breeding for cultivars with high yield-potential and those that thrive well under diverse and extreme environmental conditions. Improved crop varieties alone do not boost crop productivity unless supplemented with optimum soil, water, and plant management practices as well as the promotion of policies pertaining to inputs, credit, extension, and marketing. Studies in Kenya and Uganda have shown that the yield of cassava can be increased by 140% in farmers' fields using improved varieties and management practices. In addition to traditional organic and inorganic fertilizers, biochar and African Dark Earths have been found to improve soil properties and to enhance productivity, although their availability and affordability to African farmers remains to be explored. The concept of Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) has been successfully implemented in some African countries in the Great Lake Region. Other innovative technologies favorably accepted by farmers are the Push-pull System (an elegant method of controlling a devastating insect pest and a parasitic weed) and NERICA (New Rice for Africa, in which rice varieties with desirable nutritional and agronomic properties were developed by crossing Asian and African rice). This review calls for African governments and institutions not only to provide conducive environments but also to abide by the Maputo 2003 Declaration where they agreed to invest 10% of their national budget to agricultural research and development as the outcome has a positive impact on productivity and ultimately improves the livelihood of farmers.

TI Optimization and modeling of biohydrogen production by mixed bacterial
   cultures from raw cassava starch
SO FRONTIERS OF CHEMICAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB The production of bio-hydrogen from raw cassava starch via a mixed-culture dark fermentation process was investigated. The production yield of H-2 was optimized by adjusting the substrate concentration and the microorganism mixture ratio. A maximum H-2 yield of 1.72 mol H-2/mol glucose was obtained with a cassava starch concentration of 10 g/L to give a 90% utilization rate. The kinetics of the substrate utilization and of the generation of both hydrogen and volatile fatty acids were also investigated. The substrate utilization follows pseudo first order reaction kinetics, whereas the production of both H-2 and the VFAs correlate with the Gompertz equation. These results show that cassava is a good candidate for the production of biohydrogen.

TI Spatio-temporal model for crop yield forecasting
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS
AB This paper proposes a linear mixed model (LMM) with spatial effects, trend, seasonality and outliers for spatio-temporal time series data. A linear trend, dummy variables for seasonality, a binary method for outliers and a multivariate conditional autoregressive (MCAR) model for spatial effects are adopted. A Bayesian method using Gibbs sampling in Markov Chain Monte Carlo is used for parameter estimation. The proposed model is applied to forecast rice and cassava yields, a spatio-temporal data type, in Thailand. The data have been extracted from the Office of Agricultural Economics, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives of Thailand. The proposed model is compared with our previous model, an LMM with MCAR, and a log transformed LMM with MCAR. We found that the proposed model is the most appropriate, using the mean absolute error criterion. It fits the data very well in both the fitting part and the validation part for both rice and cassava. Therefore, it is recommended to be a primary model for forecasting these types of spatio-temporal time series data.

TI Contamination of Fried Foods by 3-Monochloropropane-1,2-diol Fatty Acid
   Esters During Frying
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN OIL CHEMISTS SOCIETY
AB In the present work, different foods including banana, potato, cassava, onion, garlic, polenta, rice balls and beef patties were investigated in relation to the possible endogenous formation of 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol fatty acid esters (bound 3-MCPD) and carry-over of these contaminants from the oil due to fat uptake during frying. For that, the samples were fried in two different types of oil and bound 3-MCPD was determined by using an indirect method based on acid transesterification and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry analysis. The compounds were not detected in the fried foods when corn oil containing non-significant levels of bound 3-MCPD (< 0.05 mg kg(-1)) was used, indicating no endogenous formation during frying. On the other hand, when the same foods were fried in palm oil containing 1.64 mg kg(-1) of bound 3-MCPD, the mean concentrations ranged from 0.12 to 0.25 mg kg(-1), indicating a clear carry-over of the contaminants. In this case, a good correlation was observed between the levels of the compounds in fried samples and water loss/fat uptake.

TI Brazilian Dioscoreaceas starches Thermal, structural and rheological

SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY
AB Determination of the characteristics of native starches is crucial in order to select their best application in various industrial fields. Thus, two different types of non-traditional native starches from the Dioscoreaceas species (Dioscorea sp. and Dioscorea piperifolia Humb. var. Wild) were studied regarding their thermal, structural and rheological properties. The results were contrasted with traditional commercial starch sources (potato, cassava and corn). From the thermogravimetric results (TG/DTG), D. piperifolia starch obtained the highest thermal stability of the samples, except for potato starch. Furthermore, using differential scanning calorimetry and viscoamylograph profiles (RVA), it was found that the Dioscoreaceas starches presented a higher onset (T (o)) temperature and susceptibility to retrogradation. They also showed lower values in relation to relative crystallinity, which was calculated from their X-ray patterns and tendency to white (L*) colour. The shapes of the Discoreaceas starch granules were determined using electron microscopy; it was found that as the potato starch the Dioscoreaceas starches showed a wide range of particle size.

SO STARCH-STARKE
AB Starch from marama (Tylosema esculentum) storage roots were isolated and characterized for physicochemical, micro- and molecular structure, pasting, and thermal properties, and were compared to commercial cassava, maize, and potato starches. The amylose content of marama root starch was 192g/kg starch; and was close to cassava (196g/kg), but lower in comparison to maize (250g/kg) and higher than potato (161g/kg). Marama root starch granules were found to be simple; spherical, lenticular, and oval in shape with granule size range of about 5-38 mu m. The peak viscosity (5350-5475mPa<bold>s</bold>) of marama root starch paste is about twice as high as those of cassava and maize. Marama root starch has higher gel firmness than cassava but half that of potato and maize starches. Gelatinization temperature range (67.5-79.0 degrees C) of marama root starch was close to commercial cassava and maize starches. Marama root starch exhibited type A molecular arrangement (X-ray diffraction) pattern similar to the cassava and maize starches, but different to type B exhibited by the potato starch. Granule size, amylose:amylopectin ratio and molecular arrangement pattern seem to account for the differences and or similarities between marama root starch and the commercial starches. Marama starch has potential as thickeners in food compared to maize and cassava due to the high viscosity.

SO STARCH-STARKE
AB Cassava bagasse is a semisolid material resulting from the extraction of native starch. It represents up to 30% w/w of the original roots used in this process. The equilibrium moisture content (Xe) is an important factor in the drying process of materials that is studied using desorption isotherms. The objectives of this study were to characterize the cassava bagasse obtained from an industrial process and to define desorption isotherm models. Desorption isotherms were obtained within a temperature range of 25-40 degrees C and a water activity range of 0.11-0.97. The results showed a material with a low protein content (<1%), a starch content of 41.25% dry basis, and 58.19% of fiber, with the presence of these two compounds confirmed by the SEM images and XRD diffractograms. The Xe did not show dependence on temperature, and the data showed a good fit to the modified Peleg, GAB, and Oswin models, with determination coefficient values (R-2)>0.96 and mean relative percent errors (%E) <10%.

   its application in starch hydrolysis
SO STARCH-STARKE
AB alpha-Amylase from Cryptococcus flavus was previously purified after exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-100. The enzyme was purified 128-fold with a recovery rate of 81% of activity. The molecular mass of the -amylase was 67kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. The enzyme was characterized after immobilization on glass tubes. The immobilization yield, efficiency, and activity recovery of -amylase were 79, 57, and 45%, respectively. The optimum pH of the immobilized enzyme was shifted to a more acidic pH (4.5) compared with the free enzyme (5.5). The optimum temperature of the immobilized enzyme was the same for the free enzyme (50 degrees C), but it showed a higher thermal stability. The immobilized enzyme showed activity until the 10th cycle, maintaining 47% of initial activity, and was capable of hydrolyzing starch from potato, wheat, corn, and cassava. The main products released from starch were maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetraose.

TI Ionic-liquid pretreatment of cassava residues for the cogeneration of
   fermentative hydrogen and methane
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB An ionic liquid of N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) was used to effectively pretreat cassava residues for the efficient enzymatical hydrolysis and cogeneration of fermentative hydrogen and methane. The reducing sugar yield of enzymolysed cassava residues with NMMO pretreatment improved from 36 to 42 g/100 g cassava residues. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed the formation of deep grooves ( similar to 4 mu m wide) and numerous pores in the cassava residues pretreated with NMMO. X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the crystallinity coefficient of NMMO-pretreated cassava residues decreased from 40 to 34. Fourier transform infrared spectra indicated that crystal cellulose I was partially transformed to amorphous cellulose II in the NMMO-pretreated cassava residues. This transformation resulted in a reduced crystallinity index from 0.85 to 0.77. Hydrogen yield from the enzymolysed cassava residues pretreated with NMMO increased from 92.3 to 126 mL/g TVS, and the sequential methane yield correspondingly increased from 79.4 to 101.6 mL/g TVS.

TI Effect of weed control methods on the yield and starch content of
   storage root of cassava (Manihot esculenta) and soil health
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB A field experiment was conducted to study the effect of different weed control methods on the yield and starch content of storage root of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) grown under irrigated conditions. The results revealed that weed control ground cover (WCGC)/weed control mat mulching and four manual weeding at 1, 2, 3 and 4 MAP significantly reduced the dry weed biomass. The mean fresh storage root yield of cassava obtained from the plots where WCGC was used statistically at par with the storage root yield of cassava from the plots where four manual weedings were done. Compared to four manual weedings, pre-emergence application of oxyfluorfen along with two manual weedings at 2, 3 MAP and two manual weedings at 1, 2 MAP along with post-emergence application of glyphosate at 3 MAP resulted in insignificant reduction (9.6 and 10.1%, respectively) in the storage root yield. Compared to other methods of weed control, WCGC resulted in maximum dry matter partitioning efficiency and soil microbial population. Application of glyphosate had no adverse effect on the starch content of storage root but resulted in higher soil organic carbon.

TI Gene expression atlas for the food security crop cassava
SO NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta) feeds c. 800 million people world-wide. Although this crop displays high productivity under drought and poor soil conditions, it is susceptible to disease, postharvest deterioration and the roots contain low nutritional content.
   Here, we provide molecular identities for 11 cassava tissue/organ types through RNA-sequencing and develop an open access, web-based interface for further interrogation of the data.
   Through this dataset, we consider the physiology of cassava. Specifically, we focus on identification of the transcriptional signatures that define the massive, underground storage roots used as a food source and the favored target tissue for transgene integration and genome editing, friable embryogenic callus (FEC). Further, we identify promoters able to drive strong expression in multiple tissue/organs.
   The information gained from this study is of value for both conventional and biotechnological improvement programs.

SO TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB This study was conducted to determine the effects of mixtures of liquid brewer's yeast (LBY) and cassava pulp (CVP) with rice straw (RS) on feed intake, digestibility, rumen fermentation, and growth of dairy heifers. Sixteen Holstein crossbred heifers (13.8 +/- 1.6 months old, 210 +/- 23 kg body weight (BW)) were randomly allocated to four feeding treatments with four replications, which were 0:0:100 (RS), 0:70:30 (0%LBY), 20:50:30 (20%LBY), and 50:20:30 (50%LBY), respectively, for LBY/CVP/RS on a fresh matter basis. The heifers were offered conventional concentrate at 1.5% initial body weight daily and fed the treatment diets ad libitum. Average daily gain and feed intake were not significantly different among the treatments. The heifers fed 50%LBY had the highest crude protein (CP) intake and DM, OM, and CP digestibility (P < 0.05). The ruminal pH did not differ significantly among treatments, while NH3-N was the highest (P < 0.05) in 50%LBY. Total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations and the molar proportion of each VFA were not significantly different among the treatments. Blood urea nitrogen concentrations of 50%LBY were the highest among the treatments (P < 0.05). The results indicated that 50%LBY improved CP digestibility.

TI Enhancing saccharification of cassava stems by starch hydrolysis prior
   to pretreatment
SO INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB Chemical characterization of cassava stems from different origin revealed that glucans accounted for 54-63% of the dry weight, whereas 35-67% of these glucans consisted of starch. The cassava stems were subjected to a saccharification study including starch hydrolysis, pretreatment with either sulfuric acid or 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([Emim]OAc), and enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose. Starch hydrolysis prior to pretreatment decreased sugar degradation, improved enzymatic convertibility of cellulose, and increased overall glucan conversion. Glucan recovery after pretreatment of starch-free cassava stems (SFCS) was around 85%, but below 52% when the stems were pretreated under the same conditions without preparatory starch hydrolysis. The total amount of hydrolyzed glucan after cellulose hydrolysis was two-fold higher for pretreated SFCS than for directly pretreated stems. Pretreatment with [Emim]OAc resulted in 20% higher glucan conversion than pretreatment with acid. Pyrolysis-GC/MS, X-ray diffraction, CP/MAS C-13 NMR and FTIR analyses revealed major differences between H2SO4- and [Emim]OAc-pretreated material. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Screening of some cassava starches for their potential applications in
   custard and salad cream productions
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD MEASUREMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION
AB Custard powder and salad cream are two food products commercially manufactured using different quantities of corn starch. This study aimed at determining the physicochemical properties of some starches extracted from some white and yellow root cassava varieties. The prospective applicability of the cassava starches in custard powder and salad cream production was also determined. The physical, chemical and functional properties of eight cassava starches were determined using standard analytical procedures. Sensory acceptability of the products was also determined using untrained consumer group. Products made from corn starch were used as the reference samples. The physical, chemical and functional properties of the cassava starches varied significantly (p < 0.05). The results of multivariate data analysis (principal component and cluster analyses) showed that it was difficult to completely discriminate starches from the yellow fleshed and white fleshed cassava roots. Texture was the most important sensory attribute determining the two products' acceptability. Starch powder dispersibility was found to have significant influence (p < 0.05) on the sensory acceptability of the two products. However, starch from a yellow fleshed root (TMS 01/1368) was the most preferred for salad cream making while starch from a white fleshed root (TMS 30572) was the most preferred for making custard powder. The starches showed high potential to replace corn starch for the respective product manufacture.

TI Physico-chemical properties of Wikau maombo flour from cassava (Manihot
   esculenta Crantz)
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD MEASUREMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION
AB Wikau maombo flour has a great potential as an economical food products in Southeast Sulawesi. The aims of this study were to apply the traditional methods of cassava flour manufacturing process roomates including peeling, washing, the immersion of sea water, fermentation, drying, milling and analyze the characteristic of wikau Matombo flour. The cassava was immersed for 24 h in sea water prior to fermentation in 1-4 days. Fermented flour in 3 days is the choosen product due to its good organoleptic and mass-produced analysis. The cyanide content of the flour was 2.7 mg/kg, whereas the content of carbohydrate, protein, fat, ash, moisture and crude fiber were 87.69 +/- 0.1, 2.4 +/- 0.1, 0.34 +/- 0.02, 1.04 +/- 0.59, 6.23 +/- 0.48 and 2.30 +/- 0.72 %, respectively. FTIR analysis showed that the intensity of peaks in 1016, 1150, 1650, 2990 and 3390 cm(-1) were found to decrease with a longer fermentation. Based on the XRD analysis, the crystallinity of Wikau maombo flour decreased as the fermentation time increase. With a long fermentation, the morphology of the flour was observed as irregular granules with starch granule size. The physicochemical properties of wikau Matombo flour including swelling power, crystallinity, solubility, cyanide content, viscosity, pasting temperature, pH and granule size were 8.39 +/- 0.06 g/g, 24.41 %, 66 +/- 0.27 %, 2.7 +/- 0.03 mg/kg, 4061cP, 74.1 degrees C, 6.5 +/- 0.05 and 5-15 mu m, respectively.

TI Intestinal microbial ecology and hematological parameters of broiler fed
   cassava waste pulp fermented with Acremonium charticola
SO VETERINARY WORLD
AB Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of feeding Acremonium charticola-fermented cassava pulp (AC-FCP) on the intestinal microbial ecology and hematological indices of broiler chickens.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 240 male Lohman day-old-chicks were randomly allotted to one of the four experimental diets including control diet, control diet + antimicrobials (neomycin; 300 mg/kg diet), diet containing AC-FCP (16 g/100 g diet) or diet containing AC-FCP + antimicrobials. At day 28, the birds from each pen were blood sampled, sacrificed and immediately the internal organs were removed and weighed. Digesta were obtained from the ileum and cecum.
   Results: Birds fed AC-FCP had lower (p<0.05) coliform bacteria count in the ileal digesta than birds fed control diet or control diet + antimicrobials. Butiric acid was higher (p<0.05) in the cecal content of birds fed AC-FCP than in other birds. Propionic acid was also higher in AC-FCP fed birds than in other birds although statistically not significant. The percentages of lymphocytes and heterophils were higher (p<0.05) and tended (p=0.07) to be lower, respectively, in broilers fed control diet than in other birds. The birds provided control diet had lower (p<0.05) heterophils to lymphocytes ratio compared to those receiving AC-FCP or AC-FCP + antimicrobials. Serum total protein and globulin were higher (p<0.01) in birds fed control diet or control diet + antimicrobials compared to AC-FCP or AC-FCP + antimicrobials fed birds. Serum albumin was lower (p<0.01) in AC-FCP birds than that in other birds. There was a tendency (p=0.09) that birds fed AC-FCP diet had lower total serum cholesterol than other birds.
   Conclusion: Feeding AC-FCP has potential to improve the intestinal health and protect the birds from acute infections.

TI Chilli leaf curl virus-based vector for phloem-specific silencing of
   endogenous genes and overexpression of foreign genes
SO APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Geminiviruses are the largest and most devastating group of plant viruses which contain ssDNA as a genetic material. Geminivirus-derived virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) vectors have emerged as an efficient and simple tool to study functional genomics in various plants. However, previously developed VIGS vectors have certain limitations, owing to their inability to be used in tissue-specific functional study. In the present study, we developed a Chilli leaf curl virus (ChiLCV)-based VIGS vector for its tissue-specific utilization by replacing the coat protein gene (open reading frame (ORF) AV1) with the gene of interest for phytoene desaturase (PDS) of Nicotiana benthamiana. Functional validation of ChiLCV-based VIGS in N. benthamiana resulted in systemic silencing of PDS exclusively in the phloem region of inoculated plants. Furthermore, expression of enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) using the same ChiLCV vector was verified in the phloem region of the inoculated plants. Our results also suggested that, during the early phase of infection, ChiLCV was associated with the phloem region, but at later stage of pathogenesis, it can spread into the adjoining non-vascular tissues. Taken together, the newly developed ChiLCV-based vector provides an efficient and versatile tool, which can be exploited to unveil the unknown functions of several phloem-specific genes.

TI Encapsulation and Stabilization of beta-Carotene in Amaranth Matrices
   Obtained by Dry and Wet Assisted Ball Milling
SO FOOD AND BIOPROCESS TECHNOLOGY
AB Amaranth starchy fractions have recently awakened interest from the industry, mainly due to its potential functional characteristics. The encapsulating efficiencies of starch-enriched fraction (SEF) and native starch (NS) obtained, respectively, by dry and wet assisted ball milling were studied. The effects of high impact milling, gelatin addition, and storage temperature (5-45 A degrees C, 45 days) on the retention of beta-carotene were investigated. Significant effects of both milling and amaranth protein present in SEF matrix on emulsification and subsequent retention of beta-carotene were found. Ball milled SEF matrix showed the best encapsulation performance, with up to three times of total beta-carotene content in comparison with the NS-containing matrices. Degradation of surface and encapsulated beta-carotene followed a first-order kinetic model and was strongly influenced by storage temperature. The activation energy of surface beta-carotene degradation doubled that of encapsulated beta-carotene (86 vs. 48 kJ/mol, respectively). This difference indicates that encapsulated beta-carotene is more stable to temperature changes than surface beta-carotene and revealed the protective capability of the SEF matrix even at high temperatures. The color coordinates a* and L* for samples stored at 25 and 45 A degrees C positively correlated with the remaining beta-carotene, revealing the potentiality of color measurement as an adequate index of beta-carotene retention. The starch-enriched amaranth fraction modified by high impact milling showed a high technological potential as an encapsulating agent and its own protein content served as a good emulsifier-stabilizer.

TI In vitro induction of tetraploids in cassava variety 'Xinxuan 048' using
   colchicine
SO PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE
AB Polyploids have great breeding value as they could have higher vegetative yields, higher qualities and greater tolerances against biotic and abiotic stresses. This research is focusing on in vitro colchicine-induced tetraploids in cassava. The survival rate of explants decreased with the increase of colchicine concentrations. Based on the survival rate, the treatment with 0.05 g l(-1) colchicine for 2 days was the best protocol for tetraploid induction in the cassava variety 'Xinxuan 048'. The determination of ploidy levels showed that 28 autotetraploidy and 12 mixoploidy plantlets were obtained from 44 plantlets. Thus, 90.9% of the plants were variants. Significant differences in morphology and anatomy were found between the diploid and tetraploid plants. Tetraploid plants showed better photosynthetic capacities than the original diploid plants. The tetraploid cassava regenerated herein will enrich the germplasm spectrum and open a new arena for breeding novel triploids with elite cultivars by interploid crossing in the future.

TI Genome-wide characterization and expression profiling of HD-Zip gene
   family related to abiotic stress in cassava
SO PLOS ONE
AB Homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) gene family plays important roles in various abiotic stresses and hormone signaling in plants. However, no information is currently available regarding this family in cassava (Manihot esculenta), an important drought-tolerant crop in tropical and sub-tropical areas. Here, 57 HD-Zip genes (MeHDZ01-57) were identified in the cassava genome, and they were classified into four subfamilies based on phylogenetic analysis, which was further supported by their gene structure and conserved motif characteristics. Of which five gene pairs were involved in segmental duplication but none for tandem duplication, suggesting that segmental duplication was the main cause for the expansion of MeHDZ gene family in cassava. Global expression profiles revealed that MeHDZ genes were constitutively expressed, or not expressed, or tissue-specific expressed in examined tissues in both cultivated and wild subspecies. Transcriptomic analysis of three genotypes showed that most of MeHDZ genes responded differently to drought and polyethylene glycol treatments. Subsequently, quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed comprehensive responses of twelve selected MeHDZ genes to various stimuli including cold, salt, and ABA treatments. These findings will increase our understanding of HD-Zip gene family involved in abiotic stresses and signaling transduction, and will provide a solid base for further functional characterization of MeHDZ genes in cassava.

TI Productivity and profitability of upland crop rotations in Northwest
   Cambodia
SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB The upland cropping region of Northwest Cambodia exhibits limited crop diversity, with maize and cassava dominating rain-fed production systems. Farmers in the Districts of Sala Krau in Pailin Province, and Samlout in Battambang Province, report soil fertility decline in upland cropping systems with associated reduced yields and profitability compared with five years ago. Research was conducted at one site in each of these Districts over a two year period. The purpose of the study was to investigate crop rotations in this system with a focus on better use of soil water throughout the year to increase crop yields and profitability. This included an experiment to investigate increasing cropping intensity from the usual two crops per year to three and evaluate which crop sequences would be feasible. Out of a total 15 crop sequences evaluated, only four were successful in producing viable grain yields. These were the same sequences at both sites and included maize-maize-fallow, maize-maize-sunflower, maize-soybean-fallow and maize soybean-sunflower. At Pailin, the sequence with the highest overall mean yield (4.3 t/ha) and profit was maize-maize-sunflower which returned a gross margin of $USD3700/ha over two years. The sequences with a fallow instead of a third crop produced the lowest financial returns at Pailin. However, in Samlout the maize-fallow was the most profitable sequence with an overall mean yield of 3.0 t/ha, returning $1680/ha over two years. The least profitable sequences at Samlout were the two soybean sequences. This study was successful in growing five crops in two years at Pailin, but could not reach the goal of six due to cultivar maturity length. At Samlout four crops over two years were produced, as the pre-monsoon crop was not planted in either year due to lack of sowing rainfall. Seasonal climatic factors had the greatest effect at both field sites on gross margins, which emphasized the importance of matching sowing date to rainfall to make better use of stored soil moisture to optimise yield and profitability. At Pailin, mean seasonal surface soil moisture, hundred seed weight and harvest index also impacted gross margin returns. This research validated the stability of maize in the farming system while sunflower should be further investigated in cropping sequences. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A comprehensive review on biomass and solar energy for sustainable
   energy generation in Nigeria
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa (7th most populous in the world) and it is strategic to the realization of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. However, SDG No. 7 (affordable and clean energy) and other goals connected to the reduction of climate change are crucial for the attainment of sustainable development in Nigeria. This comprehensive review encompasses the discussions of the clean energy potential, obstacles to and stimulants of clean energy implementations, and renewable energy policies in Nigeria. Solar and biomass resources have been presented in this article because of their huge availability in Nigeria. Nigeria has the potential to produce an estimated 47.97 million tonnes of oil equivalent (MTOE) annually from biomass resources. Likewise, 17, 459 billion MJ/day of solar energy is incident on the total surface of Nigeria. The biomass resources which can be tapped for renewable energy production in Nigeria include Jatropha with high oil contents, sweet sorghum and molasses; food crops such as cassava, rice, coconut, cashew, millet, rice, oil palm, maize, and yam; agricultural residues and wastes from food crops such as cassava peels, cassava liquid sludge, mango peel, mango seed kernel, rice husks (RH), corn residues, oil palm derivatives, sugar cane straw, and bagasse; forest resources; municipal solid wastes; and animal wastes. These resources can be exploited for the production of biogas, bioethanol, biodiesel, briquettes and organic fertilizers through anaerobic digestion, transesterification, gasification, pyrolysis, and briquetting. There are also huge potentials for the deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) and thermal systems in off-grid, grid-connected, and hybrid installations. It can be concluded that the techno-economic feasibility and environmental significance of solar power and bioenergy for Nigeria's sustainable development is site-specific and subject to factors such as incentives and financing, research and development, public enlightenment, government's policies, and private investments.

TI Preparation of A. succinogenes immobilized microfiber membrane for
   repeated production of succinic acid
SO ENZYME AND MICROBIAL TECHNOLOGY
AB A new applicability of cell-immobilized system for biological production of target chemical was reported in this work. A. succinogenes CCTCC M2012036 was immobilized on positively charged polypropylene microfiber membrane by physical interaction and were used for converting glucose into succinic acid. Glucose consumption and succinic acid production kinetics were investigated for optimizing the operational parameters. The cell-immobilized membrane presented good reuse stability, and six cycles of fermentation without activity loss were realized with an average succinic acid yield of 0.83 g/g. Importantly, a biofilm was formed which favored the production of succinic acid. A microfiber membrane bioreactor was further constructed with the cell-immobilized membrane to perform fermentation in a larger scale, and the yield and productivity of succinic acid were 0.82 g/g and 1.04g L-1 h(-1) using a fed batch strategy. By combining mesoporous support with biotechnological techniques, this work offered a prospect of adopting reusable cells feasible for industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The cooking methods may influence the retention of nutrients and phytochemicals contents of vegetables showing the requirement to know the best way of cooking. Highlighting that in terms of nutrition is not only sufficient to relate the total content of certain food nutrients, but also to know the amount absorbed and consumed by the body. In this way, this study aimed to evaluate the bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of Cassava processed using three different cooking methods (steam, boiling and microwaving). The results showed that the total polyphenols' content were significantly different after treatments, showing variation 25.81 (steam) to 16.59 (boiling) for cassava. The antioxidant activity, determined by the ABTS method, differ significantly in all cooking methods for cassava, wherein: Boiling > microwaving > steam. It was observed a reduction in the total phenolics content and antioxidant activity in the samples after the simulated gastrointestinal digestion in vitro, for all cooking methods. These research showed the bioaccessible percentage of total polyphenols and antioxidant activity were, respectively >70% and ranging from 30 to 40%, for all samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The influence of the preparation method and the effect of in vitro digestion on the fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and malto-oligosaccharides (MALTOS) of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas Lam), mandioquinha (Arracacia xanthorrhiza), white yam (Dioscorea alata L.), cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), and taro (Colocasia esculenta) were evaluated. Tubers/roots were cooked in two ways: whole/unpeeled and peeled/in cubes. In vitro digestion was performed on whole/unpeeled cooked vegetables. An oligosaccharide analysis was carried out by HPAE-PAD. The largest amounts of oligosaccharides were found in the whole/unpeeled cooked tubers/roots. Sweet potato showed the highest content of FOS (29.08 +/- 1.60 mg/100 g) and the highest concentrations of MALTOS were observed in white yam (113.70 +/- 3.41 mg/100 g). In vitro digestion promoted an increase in maltotriose in all tubers/roots. Sweet potato FOS were not changed by digestion. However, in mandioquinha, white yam, and cassava, FOS levels were higher after digestion. The increase in MALTOS after in vitro digestion may be associated with both the hydrolysis of oligosaccharides with a higher degree of polymerization and starch. FOS contents increased after digestion possibly by hydrolysis of inulin or release from the food matrix. Sweet potato, cassava, and white yams can contribute to an increased intake of prebiotics.

TI Optimization of Gluten-Free Tulumba Dessert Formulation Including Corn
   Flour: Response Surface Methodology Approach
SO POLISH JOURNAL OF FOOD AND NUTRITION SCIENCES
AB Tulumba dessert is widely preferred in Turkey; however, it cannot be consumed by celiac patients because it includes gluten. The diversity of gluten-free products should be expanded so that celiac patients may meet their daily needs regularly. In this study, corn flour (CF) / potato starch (PS) blend to be used in the gluten-free tulumba dessert formulation was optimized using the Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Increasing ratio of PS in the CF-PS led to a decrease in hardness of the dessert and to an increase in expansion, viscosity, adhesiveness, yield of dessert both with and without syrup (P<0.05). When considering the properties used in optimization process, the optimum formulation was found to be as 201.52 g water and 0.18 g CMC and 100 g blend of CF-PS at the rates of 59: 41. In sensory evaluation test, appearance, symmetry, crispness and aftertaste properties of the gluten-free dessert prepared from this formulation were very close to control sample (P>0.05), additionally these desserts had a much higher sensory score compared to the control sample in terms of the overall quality and pore structure (P<0.05).

TI Physicochemical properties of maca starch
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB Maca (Lepidium meyenii Walpers) is gaining research attention due to its unique bioactive properties. Starch is a major component of maca roots, thus representing a novel starch source. In this study, the properties of three maca starches (yellow, purple and black) were compared with commercially maize, cassava, and potato starches. The starch granule sizes ranged from 9.0 to 9.6 mu m, and the granules were irregularly oval. All the maca starches presented B-type X-ray diffraction patterns, with the relative degree of crystallinity ranging from 22.2 to 24.3%. The apparent amylose contents ranged from 21.0 to 21.3%. The onset gelatinization temperatures ranged from 47.1 to 47.5 degrees C as indicated by differential scanning calorimetry. Significant differences were observed in the pasting properties and textural parameters among all of the studied starches. These characteristics suggest the utility of native maca starch in products subjected to low temperatures during food processing and other industrial applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Gel characteristics and microstructure of fish myofibrillar

SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB The changes in fish myofibrillar protein/cassava starch composites in the starch fraction range from 0 to 1, with their total content maintained at 60 mg/mL, were investigated in terms of textural properties, rheological behaviours, morphology, spatial distribution and protein molecular structure. The results revealed that the starch fraction of 0.5 was a critical point for the conversion of the protein matrix to starch matrix and conversion of the gel from elastic to weak. Moreover, the protein-starch synergistic effect on the storage modulus was strongest at fractions of 0.5 and 0.6, due to the formation of a semi-interpenetrating network, with more amylose from the melted starch granules interpenetrated with the protein molecules, and the absorption of water by the starch granules to concentrate the protein matrix. Additionally, no covalent interaction between the protein and starch occurred with increasing starch fraction, thus having no significant influence on the protein secondary structure.

SO JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
AB Gel-combustion by a bio-fuel, processed starch of the root tuber of cassava (Manihot esculenta), was used to prepare vanadium pentoxide nanowire clusters (V2O5NWC). The as-synthesized product was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) UVeVisible spectroscopy and Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance of V2O5NWC has been evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic cycling (GC) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The V2O5NWC had a discharge capacity of 188 mAh g(-1) with better capacity retention of 90% at the end of the 50th cycle, which corresponds to a coulombic efficiency of around 99%. The rate performance of the compound is also carried out and it has shown excellent performance. EIS was used to study the kinetic properties of Li+ ions for V2O5NWC and the fitted resistance and capacitance values are discussed in detail. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Cyanogen Metabolism in Cassava Roots: Impact on Protein Synthesis and
   Root Development
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), a staple crop for millions of sub-Saharan Africans, contains high levels of cyanogenic glycosides which protect it against herbivory. However, cyanogens have also been proposed to play a role in nitrogen transport from leaves to roots. Consistent with this hypothesis, analyses of the distribution and activities of enzymes involved in cyanide metabolism provides evidence for cyanide assimilation, derived from linamarin, into amino acids in cassava roots. Both beta-cyanoalanine synthase (CAS) and nitrilase (NIT), two enzymes involved in cyanide assimilation to produce asparagine, were observed to have higher activities in roots compared to leaves, consistent with their proposed role in reduced nitrogen assimilation. In addition, rhodanese activity was not detected in cassava roots, indicating that this competing means for cyanide metabolism was not a factor in cyanide detoxification. In contrast, leaves had sufficient rhodanese activity to compete with cyanide assimilation into amino acids. Using transgenic low cyanogen plants, it was shown that reducing root cyanogen levels is associated with elevated root nitrate reductase activity, presumably to compensate for the loss of reduced nitrogen from cyanogens. Finally, we overexpressed Arabidopsis CAS and NIT4 genes in cassava roots to study the feasibility of enhancing root cyanide assimilation into protein. Optimal overexpression of CAS and NIT4 resulted in up to a 50% increase in root total amino acids and a 9% increase in root protein accumulation. However, plant growth and morphology was altered in plants overexpressing these enzymes, demonstrating a complex interaction between cyanide metabolism and hormonal regulation of plant growth.

TI Amylopectin small chain glucans form structure fingerprint that
   determines botanical origin of starch
SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB Starch granule size, shape and structure of amylopectin are species specific and influence starch properties and end-use of starch. Amylopectin glucan chain structure was used to predict the starch botanical sources. Mathematical probability for accumulation of small glucan chains DP 6-10 reveal exponential fit curve with maximum R-2 in smallest granule size starches (Chlamydomonas, quinoa, buckwheat). Cereal and cassava showed R-2 of 0.81-0.96 while in pulses and tubers it was less than 0.7. The amylopectin small glucan chains form a unique 'finger print region' that identified starch botanical source. Differential amylopectin chain length distribution (APCLD) graphs between DP 6-80 of all species from Chiamydomonas starch distinguished five structural groups that clustered the 31 analyzed starches into four major patterns. APCLD analyses of amylopectin combined with characteristic pattern of small linear DP (6-9) glucan chains predicted the starch botanical source. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Heterologous expression of Aspergillus aculeatus endo-polygalacturonase
   in Pichia pastoris by high cell density fermentation and its application
   in textile scouring
SO BMC BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Background: Removal of non-cellulosic impurities from cotton fabric, known as scouring, by conventional alkaline treatment causes environmental problems and reduces physical strength of fabrics. In this study, an endo-polygalacturonase (EndoPG) from Aspergillus aculeatus produced in Pichia pastoris was evaluated for its efficiency as a bioscouring agent while most current bioscouring process has been performed using crude pectinase preparation.
   Results: The recombinant EndoPG exhibited a specific activity of 1892.08 U/mg on citrus pectin under the optimal condition at 50 degrees C, pH 5.0 with a V-max and K-m of 65,451.35 mu mol/min/mL and 15.14 mg/mL, respectively. A maximal activity of 2408.70 +/- 26.50 U/mL in the culture supernatant was obtained by high cell density batch fermentation, equivalent to a 4.8 times greater yield than that from shake-flask culture. The recombinant enzyme was shown to be suitable for application as a bioscouring agent, in which the wettability of cotton fabric was increased by treatment with enzyme at 300 U/mL scouring solution at 40 degrees C, pH 5.0 for 1 h. The bio-scoured fabric has comparable wettability to that obtained by conventional chemical scouring, but has higher tensile strength.
   Conclusion: The work has demonstrated for the first time functions of A. aculeatus EndoPG on bioscouring in eco-textile processing. EndoPG alone was shown to possess effective scouring activity. High expression level and homogeneity could be achieved in bench-scale bioreactor.

SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of replacing corn starch by whey protein isolated (WPI) in biodegradable polymer blends developed by extrusion. X-ray diffraction showed the presence of a Vh-type crystalline arrangement. The films were homogeneous, indicating strong interfacial adhesion between the protein and the thermoplastic starch matrix (TPS) as observed in scanning electron microscopy. The addition of WPI on TPS matrix promoted an increase in the thermal stability of the materials. It was observed 58.5% decrease in the water vapor permeability. The effect of corn starch substitution by WPI on mechanical properties resulted in a more resistant and less flexible film when compared the TPS film. The addition of WPI caused greenish yellow color and less transparent films. The substitution of corn starch by WPI made it possible to obtain polymer blends with improved properties and represents an innovation for application as a packaging material.

SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB This work aimed to obtain and characterize nanofibers from cassava bagasse and peelings, which are waste originating from cassava starch extraction. To isolate the nanofibers, a combination of pre-treatments (alkaline treatment, Q-chelating treatment, bleaching), acid hydrolysis, and a final ultrasonic disintegration step were used. Acidic hydrolysis was conducted at a constant temperature of 60 degrees C; the acid concentration (30, 40, and 50%) and the treatment time (30, 60, and 90 min) were varied. The nanofibers were characterized for their morphology, surface charge, crystallinity index (XRD), and functional groups (FTIR). The diameters of the nanofibers ranged from 2.3 nm to 5.4 nm. The zeta potential values were lower than -47.7 mV. As expected, all the products derived from acid hydrolysis displayed high crystallinity index. Finally, FTIR analysis confirmed that the isolation processes effectively removed amorphous materials such as lignin and hemicellulose from the nanofibers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB The aim of this study was to determine and compare the melting (T-m), glass transition (T-g) and mechanical relaxation (T-alpha) temperatures of a new waxy cassava starch. Thermal transitions measurements were obtained by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Dynamical Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA). The experimental data showed a high correlation between water volume fraction and melting temperature (T-m) indicating that the Flory-Huggins theory can be used to describe the thermal behavior of this starch. The T-m of waxy cassava starch-water mixes were lower than a waxy corn starch-water reference system, but differences were not statistically significant. The mechanical relaxation temperatures taken at tan delta peaks were found 29-38 degrees C larger than T-g. The T-alpha and T-g measured for waxy cassava starch exhibited similar properties to the ones of waxy corn starch, implying that waxy cassava starch can be used in food and materials industry.

AB The long-term performance of the thermophilic hydrogen fermentation of cassava residue was studied in a continuous stirred tank reactor by mixed culture. The effect of different hydraulic retention times (30 days, 6 days and 3 days) on the three metabolic steps of hydrolysis, acidogenesis and hydrogen production was investigated. The highest hydrogen yield, 2.38 mmol H-2/g dry cassava residue, was achieved at an HRT of 30 days, while acetic acid (2.14 g/L) and butyric acid (2.85 g/L) were the majority of liquid by-products. It was confirmed that the addition of a nitrogen supplement ensured the stable operation of the thermophilic dark fermentation of hydrogen. The energy recovery calculations indicated that it is possible to stably operate the hydrogen fermentation of cassava residue with positive energy recovery efficiency and the highest net energy was 540.5 MJ/ton at an HRT of 30 days.

Here, we report a de novo hybrid assembly of BPM24 accession, which exhibits resistance to major fungal pathogens in Southeast Asia. Deep-coverage 454/Illumina short-read and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-read sequence data were acquired to generate a preliminary draft, which was subsequently scaffolded using a long-range "Chicago" technique to obtain a final assembly of 1.26 Gb (N50 = 96.8 kb). The assembled genome contains 69.2% repetitive sequences and has a GC content of 34.31%. Using a high-density SNP-based genetic map, we were able to anchor 28.9% of the genome assembly (363 Mb) associated with over two thirds of the predicted protein-coding genes into rubber tree's 18 linkage groups. These genetically anchored sequences allowed comparative analyses of the intragenomic homeologous synteny, providing the first concrete evidence to demonstrate the presence of paleotetraploidy in Hevea species. Additionally, the degree of macrosynteny conservation observed between rubber tree and cassava strongly supports the hypothesis that the paleotetraploidization event took place prior to the divergence of the Hevea and Manihot species.

TI Availability, production, and consumption of crops biofortified by plant
   breeding: current evidence and future potential
SO ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES
AB Biofortification is the process of increasing the density of vitamins and minerals in a crop through plant breeding-using either conventional methods or genetic engineering-or through agronomic practices. Over the past 15 years, conventional breeding efforts have resulted in the development of varieties of several staple food crops with significant levels of the three micronutrients most limiting in diets: zinc, iron, and vitamin A. More than 15 million people in developing countries now grow and consume biofortified crops. Evidence from nutrition research shows that biofortified varieties provide considerable amounts of bioavailable micronutrients, and consumption of these varieties can improve micronutrient deficiency status among target populations. Farmer adoption and consumer acceptance research shows that farmers and consumers like the various production and consumption characteristics of biofortified varieties, as much as (if not more than) popular conventional varieties, even in the absence of nutritional information. Further development and delivery of these micronutrient-rich varieties can potentially reduce hidden hunger, especially in rural populations whose diets rely on staple food crops. Future work includes strengthening the supply of and the demand for biofortified staple food crops and facilitating targeted investment to those crop-country combinations that have the highest potential nutritional impact.

TI One-step method to prepare starch-based superabsorbent polymer for slow
   release of fertilizer
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Here we report the use of a one-step process of reactive melt mixing to prepare starch-based superabsorbent polymers (SBSAPs) for the slow release of urea as a fertilizer. A modified twin-rotor mixer, with improved sealing to establish an oxygen-free environment, was used to study the chemical and physical reactions during the melt-processing through monitoring the temperature and torque. The effects of the initiator (ceric ammonium nitrate, or CAN), crosslinker (N,N'-methylene-bisacrylamide, or N,N'-MBA) and saponification agent (NaOH) under different reaction conditions (time, temperature, and shear intensity) were systematically studied. Also investigated was the effect of starch with different amylose content. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed that using this simple technique, SBSAPs were successfully prepared from either high-athylopectin starch (waxy corn starch) or high-amylose starch (Gelose 50) grafted with AM and crosslinked by N,N'-MBA. Gel strength was evaluated by rheometry, which revealed a significant increase in storage modulus (G') obtained in the crosslinked high-amylose SBSAP gels. Also, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed a more sophisticated structural network with a smaller pore size in the crosslinked high-amylose gels. Urea as a fertilizer was embedded in the SBSAP gel network, and this network controlled the urea release in water. The release rate of urea depended on the gel strength, gel microstructure and water absorption capacity (WAC) of SAP, which was affected by the reaction conditions and degree of saponification.

TI Influence of biochar amendments to soil on the mobility of atrazine
   using sorption-desorption and soil thin-layer chromatography
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Biochars, the carbonaceous residue from biomass pyrolysis, have been proposed as an agriculture soil amendment to improve soil fertility and retain a broad range of environmental contaminants. The objective of this research was therefore to investigate whether the additions of cassava wastes-based biochars obtained at 750 degrees C (noted as MS750) with the specific area of 430 m(2)/g to an agriculture soil could effectively attenuate the transport of atrazine by using laboratory batch sorption studies and soil thin-layer chromatography. To illustrate the worst-case sorption, MS750 with different application percentages (w/w: 0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 3%, 5%) were added into krasnozem soil only with 0.75% organic matter to determine sorption-desorption behavior and migration of atrazine. The results obtained indicated that the occurrence of cassava wastes-derived biochar significantly enhanced the sorption capacity of the soil for atrazine. The sorption affinity augmented as expected with application rates of MS750, and the distribution coefficients in biochar-added soils were greater than that in soil alone, likely due to enhancement of soil organic carbon content and favorable sorption domains for organic compounds caused by amendment of biochars. Sorption isotherms were characterized by nonlinear curves, which indicated the heterogeneous sites on MS750-soil mixture. Desorption work exhibited a remarkable impact of biochars amendment into soils on desorption of atrazine, in which an apparent hysteresis was undergone. This study clearly revealed that biochars from cassava wastes application enhanced retention of soil for atrazine to some extent, nevertheless, the magnitude of enhancement of the sorption affinity was still of dependence on the solution pH value, environmental temperature, as well as contact time between soil and biochars. The Delta G degrees values with less than -20 kJ/mol and the effect of solution pH variation on sorption capacity of 6 sorbents indicated that the equilibrium process may be involved physisorption, as well as accompanied with chemisorption. The results from thermodynamic analysis showed that sorption of atrazine in soils amended with MS750 was thermodynamically endothermic. Positive correlation between the mobility level of pesticide and the addition percentage of biochars suggested that the application of biochars derived from cassava waste was available to retain pesticides and attenuate the leach into groundwater. These observations provide important information on the application of biochars produced at 750 degrees C as engineered sorbents for soil remediation and compounds elimination. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI A socio-scientific analysis of the environmental and health benefits as
   well as potential risks of cassava production and consumption
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Due to its high adaptability, cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is one of the world's most cultivated and consumed plants after maize and rice. However, there are relatively few scientific studies on this important crop. The objective of this review was therefore to summarize and discuss the available information on cassava cropping in order to promote sustainable practices in terms of production and consumption. Cassava cultivation has been expanding recently at the global scale and is widely consumed in most regions of South America, Africa, and Asia. However, it is also characterized by the presence in its roots of potentially toxic hydrocyanic acid. Furthermore, cassava can also absorb pollutants as it is currently cultivated near roads or factories and generally without consideration for potential sources of soil, water, or atmospheric pollution. Careful washing, peeling, and adequate preparation before eating are therefore crucial steps for reducing human exposure to both environmental pollutants and natural hydrocyanic acid. At present, there is not enough precise data available on this staple food crop. To improve our knowledge on the nutritive benefits versus health risks associated with cassava consumption, further research is necessary to compare cassava cultivars and precisely study the influence of preparation methods.
