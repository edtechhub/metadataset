AB  - Six cassava cultivars, three yellow and three white-fleshed roots were crossed in a 3 × 3 topcross mating design to generate nine F1 populations. One thousand, one hundred and ten botanical seeds from the 9 populations were sown in pots and maintained for 42 days in a screenhouse. The emerged seedlings were transplanted to the field in April, 2010 alongside their parents (from stem cuttings), family by family. Four hundred and sixty-four progenies survived and were harvested. Both field and laboratory data were used to evaluate total carotene content (TCC), dry matter content (DMC), storage fresh root yield (SFRY) and other root quality traits. Seed germination for different populations ranged between 15.5 and 80.9 % with a mean of 43.19 %. Phenotypic variation in DMC, TCC, SFRY, biomass, root number, harvest index and cassava mosaic disease (CMD) were recorded in all the families. Average values for the populations were TCC: 4.59 μg g−1, DMC, 33.58 % and SFRY, 18.42 t ha−1. Narrow sense heritability by midparent-offspring regression analysis and genetic gains were estimated for TCC, DMC, SFRY and reaction to CMD. TCC, DMC and CMD gave high heritability estimates of 0.73, 0.83 and 0.84, respectively. SFRY, on the other hand, had a low heritability estimate (0.15). TCC was negatively correlated with DMC across all evaluation stages and locations. There were very high levels of variation in the segregating F1 progenies for all the traits. Also, narrow sense heritability estimate showed that genetic factors played a more important role than environmental factors for TCC, DMC and CMD, suggesting that reliable selection with simple recurrent phenotypic selection would be rewarding. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The carotenoid composition of gari made from biofortified cassava (BG) was compared to that of existing gari of similar appearance but made from white cassava with added red palm oil (RPG). Storage of both yellow gari products was modelled at ambient temperatures typical of tropical areas (19-40°C) over a 3-month-period at constant relative humidity. Carotenoid content and hence vitamin A activity of the gari products decreased markedly with time and temperature. Trans-β-carotene degradation fitted well the kinetics predicted by the Arrhenius model, in particular for BG. Activation energies for trans-β-carotene were 60.4 and 81.0kJmol-1 for BG and RPG respectively (R2=0.998 and 0.997, respectively); hence the minimum energy to cause degradation of trans-β-carotene in gari was lower with BG. Rates of degradation of 9-cis-β-carotene in gari were of the same order as with trans-β-carotene. Although the initial content of trans-β-carotene was twice as high in the BG compared to RPG, trans-β-carotene in BG degraded much faster. Results showed that the average shelf life at ambient temperature for BG was significantly shorter than for RPG and therefore carotenoids in BG were less stable than in RPG. © 2015 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study aimed to understand consumers' habits and belief structures concerning local food products and to develop a new snack as a way to fight against children malnutrition in Madagascar. A large variety of natural food resources grow in Madagascar, like Moringa oleifera (MO) which leaves are rich in nutrients but not consumed. First, a survey conducted in four areas of Madagascar revealed that MO leaves are known for their health benefits but infrequently consumed, probably because of their low satiating power and strong odor. In the studied areas, different levels of consumption were observed, which may be linked to varying levels of familiarity with MO by the local populations, this in turn resulting from different situations regarding geographical and historical availability. In contrary, resources such as cassava are perceived as having negative effects on health but are widely consumed because they are cheap, liked by children and satiating. The second step in the study aimed to propose products that could increase MO consumption without completely changing food practices. The acceptability of snacks associating cassava roots and MO was evaluated by means of hedonic tests performed by children. Between the snacks tested, the preferred snack contained the highest quantity of MO and was sweetened. There was no effect of area on the acceptance of the formulated snacks. This work is an evaluation of the potential of MO in the diet of malnourished population. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This experiment was conducted to determine the effects of cassava bioethanol by-product (CEP) and crude palm oil (CPO) on the carcass characteristics and meat quality of yearling heifer cattle. Eighteen crossbred Brahman × Thai heifers were randomly allotted to 2 × 3 factorial arrangement consisting of two levels of CEP (15 or 30 %, LCEP or HCEP) and 3 levels of CPO (0, 2, and 4 %). The results obtained showed that lean meat was greater (P < 0.05) in HCEP-fed cattle, but bone percentage and lean/bone ratio were less (P < 0.05) than LCEP-fed cattle. Carcass fat (P < 0.05) and fat content (P < 0.01) were significantly increased with levels of dietary CPO. Diets with 4 % CPO supplementation had better effects on redness (a*, P < 0.01) and chroma (C*, P < 0.001) values. In conclusion, up to 30 % CEP can be used to improve lean carcass and 4 % CPO can improve the redness of the meat. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effect of mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana) peel powder (MSP) supplementation on feed intake, nutrient digestibility, ruminal fermentation, and milk production in lactating dairy cows fed a concentrate containing yeast fermented cassava chip protein (YEFECAP). Four crossbred dairy cows (50 % Holstein-Friesian and 50 % Thai native breed) in mid-lactation, 404 ± 50.0 kg of body weight and 90 ± 5 day in milk with daily milk production of 9 ± 2.0 kg/day, were randomly assigned according to a 4 × 4 Latin square design to receive 4 dietary treatments. The treatments were different levels of MSP supplementation at 0, 100, 200, and 300 g/head/day. Rice straw was used as a roughage source and fed ad libitum to all cows, and concentrate containing YEFECAP at 200 g/kg concentrate was offered corresponding to concentrate to milk yield ratio at 1:2. Results revealed that feed intake, apparent nutrient digestibility, ruminal pH and temperature, and total volatile fatty acid were not significantly affected by MSP supplementation (P > 0.05). However, increasing levels of MSP supplementation increased molar proportion of propionate while ammonia-nitrogen, acetate, and acetate to propionate ratio were decreased (P < 0.01). Moreover, milk production and economic return were increased linearly (P < 0.01) with the increasing level of MSP supplementation. The present findings suggested that supplementation of MSP especially at 300 g/head/day with concentrate containing YEFECAP at 200 g/kg could improve rumen fermentation efficiency, milk production and protein content, and economical return of lactating dairy cows fed on rice straw. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Different agricultural residues were considered in this study for their ability to support cellulolytic enzyme production by Aspergillus niger. A total of eleven agricultural residues including finger millet hulls, sorghum hulls, soybean hulls, groundnut husk, banana peels, corn stalk, cassava peels, sugarcane bagasse, saw dust, rice straw and sheanut cake were subjected to three pretreatment (acid, alkali and oxidative) methods. All the residues supported the growth and production of cellulases by A. niger after 96 h of incubation. Maximum cellulase production was found in alkali-treated soybean hulls with CMCase, FPase and β-glucosidase yields of 9.91 ± 0.04, 6.20 ± 0.13 and 5.69 ± 0.29 U/g, respectively. Further studies in assessing the potential of soybean hulls are being considered to optimize the medium composition and process parameters for enhanced cellulase production. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Leaves of Mangifera Indica (MI, mango leaves) and Manihot Utilissima (MU, cassava leaves) are available in tropical regions and are the most accessible vegetal wastes of Kinshasa, capital of Democratic Republic of Congo. These wastes are not suitably managed and are not rationally valorized. They are abandoned in full air, on the soil and in the rivers. They thus pollute environment. By contrast, they can be recuperated and treated in order to produce methane (energy source), organic fertilizer and clean up the environment simultaneously. The main objective of this study was to investigate methane production from MI and MU leaves by BMP tests at 30°C. The yields achieved from the anaerobic digestion of up to 61.3 g raw matter in 1 l medium were 0.001 l/g and 0.100 l CH4/g volatile solids of MI and MU leaves, respectively. The yield of MU leaves was in the range mentioned in the literature for other leaves because of a poor presence of bioactive substrates, and low C/N ratio. This methane yield corresponded to 7% of calorific power of wood. By contrast, the methane yield from MI leaves was almost nil suggesting some metabolism inhibition because of their rich composition in carbon and bioactive substrates. Whereas classical acidogenesis and acetogenesis were recorded. Therefore, methane production from the sole MI leaves seems unfavorable by comparison to MU leaves at the ambient temperature in tropical regions. Their solid and liquid residues obtained after anaerobic digestion would be efficient fertilizers. However, the methane productivity of both leaves could be improved by anaerobic co-digestion. © 2015, Mambanzulua Ngoma et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - Background: Zinc deficiency is a significant problem, in developing countries and in vegetarians, which can be caused by plant-based diets. Thus, dietary strategies, such as fermentation, to improve zinc bioavailability of diets should be investigated. Objective: To improve zinc bioavailability in a plant-based diet by the inclusion of fermented food. Design: Cassava tubers were fermented and made to replace the unfermented cassava in a basal plant-based diet, and compared with plant-based diets with and without zinc supplement. The zinc bioavailability of the diets was evaluated in Wistar rats that were fed these diets for 28 days. The evaluation was for zinc apparent absorption (ZnAA), serum zinc levels, and zinc deposits in liver and femur; in addition, the feed efficiency ratio (FER) of the diets and femur weight (FW) of the rats were evaluated. Results: During the cassava fermentation, lactic acid increased and pH decreased (from 6.8 to 3.9), which is favorable for native phytase activity, resulting in a 90.2% reduction of phytate content in cassava. The diet containing fermented cassava showed significantly higher levels of ZnAA, FER, and FW (p<0.001). Moreover, the zinc levels in serum and femur were significantly higher (p<0.001) compared with the results of the diet with unfermented cassava. The results clearly show a higher zinc bioavailability in the diet containing fermented cassava and are comparable with the results obtained with the plant-based diet with zinc supplement. Conclusions: In conclusion, the fermentation of cassava reduces the phytate content. The diet containing the fermented cassava represents a better nutritional alternative than the diet with unfermented cassava and is comparable with the zinc-supplemented diets. © 2015 Claudia E.

AB  - Many commonly eaten foods contain toxins as a naturally occurring constituent, which could be potentially harmful to our health. Occasionally, there have been reports of food poisoning cases suspected to have been caused by consumption of vegetables and fruits containing natural toxins. Natural toxins are poisonous substances present naturally in fruits and vegetables. This chapter takes a detailed look at the following: (1) the mamey apple (Mamea americana), a dietary constituent of the Caribbean people for many generations, known for producing discomfort in some persons, especially in the digestive system; (2) tonka beans (Dipteryx odorata), which contain high concentrations of coumarin (coumarin is banned in the United States and has negative effects on the liver); (3) ackee (Blinghia sapida); the unripe fruit contains natural toxins called hypoglycin, which can cause serious health effects; and (4) cassava (Manihot esculenta.), which in its raw or unprocessed form contains cyanogenic glycoside toxins. Food poisoning from consumption of fruits and vegetables containing natural toxins is dependent on a variety of factors, such as individual susceptibility, the cooking methods, and the levels of toxin in the plant, which may vary according to the species and geographic environment. The mamey apple, tonka beans, ackee, and cassava are not commonly consumed in the developed world, so further research is needed on the regulatory aspects, especially as more and more of these fruits appear in global markets. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Cassava products obtained by submerged or solid-state fermentation, including lactic and alcoholic fermented products, are presented using their South American, African (mostly Nigerian), and Asian (mostly Indonesian) names. The role that lactic acid bacteria and amylolytic fungi play in the fermentation processes is explained in detail, and the hazards associated with these products, starting with cyanogenic compounds, continuing with mycotoxins and pathogens, and ending with choking, are reviewed, together with how to control them. Epidemiologic data in relation to cassava-associated hazards are provided and are accompanied by contemporary considerations to minimize the risk of foodborne illnesses. The regulatory frame supporting the safety of cassava fermented products is also presented. Some future trends on cassava production and processing and expectations that people have from this crop are discussed from the perspective of consumer safety. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and hemipteran honeydew are often discussed as two alternative mechanisms encouraging ant visitation in mutualistic ant–plant relationships, but little is known about the processes that generate distribution pattern in species-rich insect communities. A case study on the interaction between ants, EFN-bearing plants and hemipterans was investigated along a gradient of increasing disturbance from regenerated forest to mixed crop field. Ants, EFN-bearing plants and hemipterans sampling was conducted in these vegetations during the wet and the dry seasons in five locations. Results showed that partitioning of ant species between season and vegetation was significantly different from random. High specialization index was observed in hemipterans/plants and ant/hemipterans interactions. Low specialization index was observed between ants and EFN-bearing plants mainly in the mixed crop field. Ant species were mostly found in non-aggressive co-occurrence at nectar sources. At the species level, specialization index was high for Anoplolepis tenella (0.86 ± 0.06) and also for its associated hemipterans Stictococcus vayssierei (0.97 ± 0.02). This association is detrimental to food crop especially cassava. These results outline the effect of vegetation and food source on the structure of the ant assemblage and interaction in tropical forest zone. © 2015, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).

AB  - Economic transitions in the era of globalization warrant a fresh look at the neurological risks associated with environmental change. These are driven by industrial expansion, transfer and mobility of goods, climate change and population growth. In these contexts, risk of infectious and non-infectious diseases are shared across geographical boundaries. In low-and middle-income countries, the risk of environmentally mediated brain disease is augmented several fold by lack of infrastructure, poor health and safety regulations, and limited measures for environmental protection. Neurological disorders may occur as a result of direct exposure to chemical and/or non-chemical stressors, including but not limited to, ultrafine particulate matters. Individual susceptibilities to exposure-related diseases are modified by genetic, epigenetic and metagenomic factors. The existence of several uniquely exposed populations, including those in the areas surrounding the Niger Delta or north western Amazon oil operations; those working in poorly regulated environments, such as artisanal mining industries; or those, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, relying on cassava as a staple food, offers invaluable opportunities to advance the current understanding of brain responses to environmental challenges. Increased awareness of the brain disorders that are prevalent in low-and middle-income countries and investments in capacity for further environmental health-related research are positive steps towards improving human health.

AB  - In this study, citric acid was used to react with cassava starch in order to compare the digestibility, structural and physicochemical properties of citrate starch samples. The results indicated that citric acid esterification treatment significantly increased the content of resistant starch (RS) in starch samples. The swelling power and solubility of citrate starch samples were lower than those of native starch. Compared with native starch, a new peak at 1724 cm-1 was appeared in all citrate starch samples, and crystalline peaks of all starch citrates became much smaller or even disappeared. Differential scanning calorimetry results indicated that the endothermic peak of citrate starches gradually shrank or even disappeared. Moreover, the citrate starch gels exhibited better freeze-thaw stability. These results suggested that citric acid esterification induced structural changes in cassava starch significantly affected its digestibility and it could be a potential method for the preparation of RS with thermal stability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article examines the production and inbound logistics activities, from farms to factories, of cassava products in Thailand. The activities are critical to the total supply-chain cost owing to the large number of farmers and stakeholders involved. The objectives of this study were to estimate the production and inbound logistics costs under different practices and to recommend a set of cost-effective practices. Data were collected from a field study and analyzed. Profits and yields under different practices of cultivation, consisting of stem usage, pest control, and weed control, were evaluated. It was found that proper pest control had significant associations with a higher yield and profit, whereas using existing stems from the previous harvest cycle had a significant association with higher profit. Furthermore, three patterns of labor hiring in harvesting activity were investigated. The results indicated that labor hiring based on a daily wage rate versus a weight-based rate were not statistically different, while a flat rate for the combined activities of harvesting and transportation was found less economical. Finally, the transportation rates of hired trucks and owned trucks were estimated and compared. The results suggested that hiring transportation services was more cost effective than using owned trucks if the truck was primarily used for cassava transportation only. The break-even numbers of trips per year for each truck type were determined as a guideline for farmers to justify owning a truck. © 2015, Kasetsart University. All rights reserved.

AB  - A three-week experiment was conducted to investigate the utilisation of a diet based on cassava root meal and copra meal by finishing broiler chickens. A total of ninety-six 21-day-old Cobb broilers were used for the experiment. The birds were weighed and allotted to six pens containing 16 birds each. A finisher diet based on cassava and copra meal and a commercial broiler finisher diet were fed each to three randomly selected pens for a period of 21 days. Results showed poorer (P < 0.05) final body weight, daily feed intake, daily gain and feed: gain ratio of birds fed the test feed compared to those fed the control commercial feed, but feed cost of meat production (WST$/kg live weight) was reduced (P < 0.05) on the test feed. Birds on the commercial feed had higher (P < 0.05) carcass and breast meat yields, while the yields of thighs and drumsticks were not affected (P > 0.05) by the diet. There were no treatment effects (P > 0.05) on the weights of the liver, heart and caeca, but birds on the test feed recorded higher (P < 0.05) weights of the pancreas, gizzard and small intestine. Birds fed the control commercial feed deposited more (P < 0.05) fat than those fed the test feed. It was concluded that cassava copra meal-based finisher diets could be used to reduce cost of meat production and abdominal fat content and thus meat quality of broiler chickens. Further research into appropriate combinations of these ingredients for optimum growth and feed utilisation by broilers is recommended. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Background: Under postharvest physiological deterioration cassava root tubers alter the expression of biosynthetic pathways of certain primary and secondary metabolites, as well as the activity of some scavenging enzymes. Therefore, in this study we hypothesized that cassava cultivars differ as to their physiological responses to deterioration and their biochemical profiles can be an indicative of the tolerance or susceptibility to deterioration. Results: The results corroborate the working hypothesis, revealing that high Levels of phenolic acids, scopoletin, carotenoids, proteins, and augmented activities of guaiacol peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide in non-stored cassava roots can be used as potential biomarkers of cassava deterioration. Conclusions: Cassava physiological deterioration depends on cultivar and many compounds are up and downregulated during storage time. Secondary metabolites, enzymes, scopoletin, scavenging reactive oxygen species, and acidic polysaccharides are activated as responses to the physiological stress induced in root tubers. © 2015 Uarrota and Maraschin.

AB  - Background In this article we present the plants used for the treatment of malaria and associated symptoms in Santa Isabel do Rio Negro in the Brazilian Amazon. The region has important biological and cultural diversities including more than twenty indigenous ethnic groups and a strong history in traditional medicine. Objective The aims of this study are to survey information in the Baniwa, Baré, Desana, Piratapuia, Tariana, Tukano, Tuyuca and Yanomami ethnic communities and among caboclos (mixed-ethnicity) on (a) plant species used for the treatment of malaria and associated symptoms, (b) dosage forms and (c) distribution of these anti-malarial plants in the Amazon. Methods Information was obtained through classical ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological methods from interviews with 146 informants in Santa Isabel municipality on the upper Negro River, Brazil. Results Fifty-five mainly native neotropical plant species from 34 families were in use. The detailed uses of these plants were documented. The result was 187 records (64.5%) of plants for the specific treatment of malaria, 51 records (17.6%) of plants used in the treatment of liver problems and 29 records (10.0%) of plants used in the control of fevers associated with malaria. Other uses described were blood fortification ('dar sangue'), headache and prophylaxis. Most of the therapeutic preparations were decoctions and infusions based on stem bark, root bark and leaves. These were administered by mouth. In some cases, remedies were prepared with up to three different plant species. Also, plants were used together with other ingredients such as insects, mammals, gunpowder and milk. Conclusion This is the first study on the anti-malarial plants from this region of the Amazon. Aspidosperma spp. and Ampelozizyphus amazonicus Ducke were the most cited species in the communities surveyed. These species have experimental proof supporting their anti-malarial efficacy. The dosage of the therapeutic preparations depends on the kind of plant, quantity of plant material available, the patient's age (children and adults) and the local expert. The treatment time varies from a single dose to up to several weeks. Most anti-malarial plants are domesticated or grow spontaneously. They are grown in home gardens, open areas near the communities, clearings and secondary forests, and wild species grow in areas of seasonally flooded wetlands and terra firme ('solid ground') forest, in some cases in locations that are hard to access. Traditional knowledge of plants was found to be falling into disuse presumably as a consequence of the local official health services that treat malaria in the communities using commercial drugs. Despite this, some species are used in the prevention of this disease and also in the recovery after using conventional anti-malarial drugs. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
